Our grandson kept saying he wanted a\" race car track \", (he`s 3 now), so we set out looking for one. My wife had gotten him several Hot Wheels cars and he loved them. I remembered how tough they were with all my crash and bang back in my younger days, so we happened upon this set on Amazon. The price was good, there were all different models in the pack, so we ordered it. When he opened it , man was he excited! He started rolling them around really easily at first,... then the crashes, the smashes, the \"big jumps\" ahh to be a kid again. Well, he`s had them for over a month now, they`re still rolling along. It`s a pretty cool thing to watch your grand kids enjoy something that you remember from your childhood. As a matter of fact, I think I still have one or two of my old Hot Wheels from back then, I wonder if he wants race poppa?",

I am unable to explain this fascination, but I am glad they have the toys to foster and nurture his interest. The trucks are well put together and can take crazy abuse. We even have a truck garage now that everyone fights over, and these work great with it. 80's kids will know that Hot Wheels are a solid buy no matter what, and it's still that way today.

I would have given this toy a 5 star review but the packaging it came in was very difficult to work with, the trucks are screwed into the cardboard and I had to go to the hardware store to buy the tiniest screwdriver set I\u2019ve ever seen.

First of all, The latch at the top is hard to close, even for me. There is almost no way he could secure it by himself. Both the front and the back of the case hold cars and you have to secure a plastic screen on the one side before you close it so the cars on that side don't fall out. Again, no way my son could do this on his own. After a few months the hinge on the bottom broke and now it constantly falls apart. Finally, the Disney Cars cars do not fit in the individual slots, nor do some of the hot wheels cars. There are larger compartments to fit larger cars.

Some slots are bigger than others and fit multiple cars. So maybe it fits more than 100, but I would personally rather see one car per slot and that way it would be easier for my four year old to use it.

On the inside however the design to hold cars was not well thought out at all. They basically want you to stack 2-3 cars on top of each other to squeeze them in the spaces that are just not properly sized for Matchbox or HotWheels vehicles. It's ok for my toddler, but all of the cars and trucks are going to end up scratched up. There is a center divider that is supposed to keep the cars from falling out when you open the case, but it fails every time and the cars all fall out everywhere.

We have an assortment of standard cars and a handful of unique like the Scooby Mystery van, Jetsons car, a Minecraft car, a canon, a tank, a helicopter.... i am debating whether to wrap the box or wrap individually. The cards they come on are a little shorter than the individual ones you buy in the store. That doesnt matter to me but thought it might if you are a collector. Overall, for $32 I got 50 unique cars, no duplicates. I am assuming I will have a very happy toddler. Now i just need to find a container for them. The box it comes in is noce but just a cardboard box and i dont think it would hold up long for a toddler.",

So this year he put his duplicates, which he played with and enjoyed, up for sale. He made $35 and i took him to a little shop i found that stills sells them 2 for a buck still in the package. He made a killing. He'll be 5 in May. Bottom line: if you order multiple packages, space them out.",

Not even after days upon days of almost constant play has even one of these small cars shown any wear and tear nor have they broken in any way.

While the cars pictured are neat, feature a lot of detailing and bright colors, the package I got contained a really bland set of cars - no detailing; mostly dark/muted colors, and while it might say \"metal parts\" on the box, there is little metal to most of the cars I got. Even the \"featured\" truck that I received is mostly plastic. Beyond disappointed with the actual cars! The other annoying part is that I ordered 2 sets, wanting one for each of my boys - 3 and almost 5. And, I got 2 of the same awful set. Why would I want 2 of the same set? So of course, as I know, I can't return them. I should have stuck to picking up cars for a dollar at the grocery store - at least then, I know what I'm getting. As for the rating, I considered giving it 2 stars, but couldn't pick anything I actually liked about the set, thus the 1-star review. Photos - Full Set; Bulldozer picture - tread doesn't move - cheap plastic part, there are little wheels underneath that allow it to move; Bland green car - no details; Boring SUV - I guess it's a Range Rover, but I never would have guessed that if it didn't say that; Torque Titan - ugly brown truck, mostly or maybe all plastic",

Can go to the dollar store and buy what you want so with similar pricing for a random assortment I would at least expect each pack to have at least 1 nice car. Now I am not sure what to do...the kids fight over cars so I have a feeling if I give that the kid with the bad pack will be fighting for the cars in the other pack. They like police cars , taxi's and school buses a lot so I was hoping to get these...or the helicopter as shown. My son would even settle for a regular bus but neither pack had. I gave this 2 stars originally but I have updated it to 1 star. I ended up ordering 3 more sets in hopes that one of them would be a good set...better than the one I wanted to replace from the first order. Instead I got 3 duplicate sets...also the same exact set as the one I wanted to replace. Frustrating to say the least. 5 sets of cars and 4 of them the exact same?? Worst part is it is a junk set...no good cars in it. I won't dare trying a third time. Now I have to figure out a different gift bcs I can't count on Amazon",

My first impression was that (within the same price range) matchbox cars are much much better built that their hot wheels counterparts, although both matchbox and hot wheels are from the same parent company. Hot wheels are mostly focused on creating fantasy versions of various race cars... and these fantasies do run extremely wild with some models. Matchbox cars are mostly miniature replicas of real world vehicles, plus construction vehicles plus fantasy versions of these construction vehicles. To give you another example.... hot wheels mostly look like various versions of a bat-mobile and matchbox look like various versions of an army truck. Also, I feel that hot wheels cars drift better while matchbox cars travel straighter and hence more suitable for playing car smash :)",

It comes with three cars and you can load a bunch more on the bottom row and more on the top. Not all Hot Wheel and Matchbox cars will fit as once in a while we run into a car that is a little too wide; the 'tracks' on the truck seem just slightly smaller than the orange race tracks. The cars on the bottom rows will shoot out the front of the truck. This action isn't exactly precise and sometimes the cars come flying out and sometimes the kind of roll out a little early when you pull the launching button back, but it's still fun. Again, some cars do better than others. Aside from the size requirement, we discovered that convertibles and other cars with lots of jagged top portions tend to get stuck so we avoid launching those. The from part of the truck has to be pushed all the way back and snapped into the trailer for the cars to launch, and in this configuration it won't move side to side. But if you pull the front part forward it will easily move side to side. If you look at the pictures this will make more sense. I will say that although I thought the launching function would be the coolest part, my son actually prefers just driving it around and loading cars onto it. He uses the launching function only occasionally. Overall, a great purchase and easily worth the price.",

I'll start off by saying that my kids (7&5) are having fun with this toy so far and it has provided a couple of hours of entertainment for sure. But I have to give it 1 star only -- having tested it with about 20 different cars, only 1 or 2 cars can make a complete loop on 1 of the 2 loops, and on the other loop almost no cars can complete the loop (they either fly off or fall off, even the car that was included in the kit), so we have not been able to really enjoy the \"crashing\" element of this toy. So I think that the kids are going to become quickly bored of it. As other reviewers have mentioned, that is basically the only function as it does not easily allow for customization or other configurations. Aside from that I think that I agree with other reviewers that it wasn't too hard to put together, although I did it instead of the kids. Overall I am thinking about returning it for a refund. I'm also disappointed in the other earlier reviewers who generally all gave it high marks, but they are almost all out of the \"vine\" program where they are sent the product for free in exchange for a review. Going forward I will be reading those reviews with a much more skeptical eye and I would remind those vine reviewers to please give us a true unbiased view of the product. Please help those of us out who are spending are hard earned $ to buy these items.",

Every chance he gets, he is playing with this toy. This is the first toy he really has ever had that he hasn't gotten bored of and put aside for awhile within a few hours to few days. I can't believe it but it's probably been our best toy investment or purchase for him ever. The cars don't crash that much as advertised, but honestly that really doesn't matter that much at all to my son. He really enjoys seeing how many he can get on the track at the same time and launching them around the loops going as fast a rate of speed as possible. The track is very, very fast for a toy car track. When the cars do crash occasionally, it's a fun surprise and change of pace for him. Most of the time though, it's just him just launching and re loading the toy cars and having them do loops at a very, very fast speed for toy cars and that's entertaining and enjoyable enough for him. I can't blame him, it's can be surprisingly addictive for the whole family when we join in too and make a game of counting how many we are launching at one time until they crash and all derail of the tracks. The Spin Storm has ended up being much more fun overall and getting far more use than his toy train table! I would caution that the Spin Storm is pretty loud unfortunately, louder than I expected it would be. This could grate on you if your child is playing it for long periods of time. We've learned to live with it since he loves it so much, though.",

Well the design of this track has 4 little plastic pieces that are used to attach the braces that hold up the track to the track. Four little separate pieces. We lost one little piece about 6 weeks after getting this track and now the entire thing is useless. I searched online to find replacement pieces with no luck. I contacted the company to inquire about purchasing a pack of these little plastic pieces and was informed that they're not available. What? Really? I can't buy replacement pieces for this track that are essential for its use? No I can't. Obviously it's on us that the piece was lost. But my children are 7 and 4. Everything gets lost. I think it's bad design and planning to have little pieces that are essential but not replaceable. So we have this new track that is completely useless. My children are disappointed and so am I.",

They are able to easily feed cars onto the track and are thrilled by the numbers of loops they can get before they jymp track. They are not into the crash aspect, but instead keep track of which cars go longer or faster. I once counted 64 full laps before a car jumped track! Now, sometimes they jump track after 1 loop, but there are enough \"long rides\" to make my little girls squeal in delight! Thousand of loops are on the 1st set of batteries too!",

It does do what it says - the cars are propelled forward into the loop by a set of sideways spinning wheels. And the car will continue going loop to loop to loop to loop forever, if it doesn't crash into another car. Only some cars will work due to wheelbase, center of gravity, size. So, be sure you have at least 6+ cars available to try; go for lower-body sporty cars. IT IS LOUD! The motor is LOUD, the cars are LOUD when they roll on the track loops, and LOUD when they crash. It's fun for kids though - to see the cars crash. You have to be careful not to get your finger smashed between two crashing cars - if you quickly put cars on the track while it's operating. But, it has an \"entry ramp\" for the cars to drive down just before they get to the spinning wheels. We had more fun with it by removing the one loop near the wheels - so the wheels would shoot the car down a long track (sold separately as many straight track pieces) which we just connected easily.",

Cons: Whilst on, the motor is incredible LOUD! This is not a toy that can be played with in a normal setting. It is a constant, and quite annoying loud sound.

This thing has been run over with a power wheels car and the track pieces simply break away without damage. Mattel really makes these tracks to last. This track runs on C batteries that will last for many hours of play. If the cars no longer make it around the track completely either you have cars with old wheels, cars that don't fit the rollers well, or the batteries are getting weak. Look for cars that have \"Track\" on their packaging....they seem to work best with this track. If your kid is sensitive to loud noises this track is loud.",

True care aficionados might get annoyed at Hot Wheels because some of their cars are a bit fantastical, but hey, kids like funky colors and shapes and shiny things! We buy 20 packs of these things (usually costs less than lunch for two people) and we dole them out to the kids as incentives to clean their rooms, for potty training, whatever you can think of. They are the ultimate carrot for good behavior. Try putting them in a grab bag so your children are surprised every time they get one!! I try to make my reviews engaging and useful.

One of the best parts is the launcher, which is really durable. It doesn\u2019t use rubber bands to launch the car, it just uses one to pull the lever back into place after launch. This is much better than the bow-and-arrow type of launchers that Hot Wheels makes, because those break quickly due to all the stress and it\u2019s hard to find replacements. It\u2019s actually easy to change the track configuration. Hot wheels cars work well on it, but a lot of matchbox cars don\u2019t (which is fine). I think every Hot Wheels car we have is compatible with the tracks themselves, and probably 30-40% of them are compatible enough to be launched and complete the 2 loops configuration. They have to have certain shapes/weights to work really well with the launcher, so you just have to try different cars to see which ones work. But that\u2019s fun, too.",

While they are a bit pricey, these sets are awesome. The ones that come in the buckets/boxes are great as there is plenty of extra space to put in cars and pieces from other sets. From my experience these are perfect for any kid aged 5-6 all the way up to grandparents. anyone can have fun playing with hot wheels cars and tracks.

                "review_text": "We have the ultimate car garage and purchased the super ultimate for the motorized elevator and tall exit ramp. Like other Hot Wheels toys with a motor, the elevator motor is very loud. We expected this, but didn't expect that even when the parking level latches are completely closed, the cars would get stuck every few seconds. The motor makes fast clicking sounds until the car can continue up the elevator to the level of choice. A minor problem is one parking space each on levels 1,2, and 3 don't have a raised bumper so the cars can stay in the parking space. If you have a child who is very particular about having a uniform look to his parking garage, this might be an issue. Cars race smoothly down the spiral ramp which is @ 29 inches tall. The tall spiral ramp is the best feature of this parking garage. The yellow wheel on level 4 requires some effort as it doesn't turn smoothly. The parking garage levels on 1, 2, and 3 near the spiral ramp slope down because the supports are @ 3 inches from the end of each level. If the motorized elevator worked well, the $199 price would be justified, even with the minor flaws. If the elevator was a manual one, I'd still pay $199 for the garage. But as is, I wouldn't pay more than $125 for this toy because of the elevator issue. We have had the garage for two days and my son refuses to play with the motorized elevator. If you're making a purchase decision between the super ultimate and the ultimate parking garages, choose the ultimate. The value is great and it doesn't have the design issues the super one has. If you already have the ultimate and are thinking of purchasing the super ultimate, you might want to wait until the price decreases. Ours is going back.",

                "review_text": "My two little boys love toy cars - Hot Wheels, Matchbox, or whatever generic brand - and my household has a small fleet of the miniature toys, track sets, and everything in between. So we obviously jumped at the chance to try out Hot Wheels Super Ultimate Garage and the results are... a bit mixed. My kids obviously love this toy but as I parent there are some big drawbacks to this toy that should definitely be considered prior to purchasing. ------------------- \u25ba Assembly: ------------------- This toy is HUGE! So it should be no surprise that it features a lot of plastics. For the most part, I think the quality of the plastics is pretty good; nothing feels like it's going to snap or break easily. The orange Hot Wheels track is pliable and easily takes the punishment from two active boys. Assembly instructions feature a full-color instruction booklet that covers every step of the process in good detail. The only tool required is a small Philips screwdriver used to open the battery compartment and install four (4) 'D' batteries (not included). The batteries operate the mechanical vehicle lift and gorilla. The rest of the components just snap together or, in the case of the track, feature plastic fasteners that slide on. There's also a small sticker booklet that contains stickers for certain parts of the garage (floor labels). My kids helped me out and we had this Super Ultimate Garage together in about 30-minutes. ------------------- \u25ba Playtime Thoughts: ------------------- As I mentioned my kids love this garage and my sons actually have enough parking to fit nearly all of their cars in one spot! Make sure you have a spot picked out to fit this toy prior to purchasing. This garage is massive at over 3' tall by about 4' long! Since we own a lot of other Hot Wheels track and sets we also love that you can incorporate more track to this garage, truly making it part of the Hot Wheels ecosystem! The toy can be configured to drop cars off at various floors thanks to gates operated on the rear of the corkscrew elevator. Cars exiting at the top floor can be configured to ramp through the jet at the top of the toy and down the orange track for another trip up the elevator. Pretty cool! ------------------- \u25ba What Could be Better: ------------------- There are some things I don't particularly care for with this toy that any potential buyer should be aware of: \u2192 The motorized vehicle lift (corkscrew) is really loud, even more so when the gorilla reaches the top of the toy and slides all the way down. \u2192 The lift does not work well at all. Large cars are just incompatible and will fail to move onto the lift. Other cars get frequently jammed causing even more noise as the corkscrew struggles to rotate. It seems that the cars that work best are the smaller, simpler Hot Wheels but that won't stop kids from sending any car onto the lift. ------------------- \u25ba Closing: ------------------- I'm not quite convinced this toy is worth the rather whopping asking price. My kids definitely love it but there are some major drawbacks, particularly if you're not a fan of loud toys. The vehicle elevator needs to be improved as it's incompatible with probably 50% of the Hot Wheels cars we own.",

Assembly is fairly simple and took about 20-30 minutes. My boys (ages 19 months, 4 and 5 years) were excited to race on the loop and the jet plane on top. My boys liked the motorized elevator a lot but the problem we experienced with the gorilla made their excitement turn to constant frustration. Perhaps ours is defective because I haven\u2019t read about others experiencing this, but in our case the gorilla\u2019s foot keeps jamming and stalling the elevator. This garage is twice the price of the original Hot Wheels garage (which my kids still play with), so we expected this new one to be out of this world! Sadly, it isn\u2019t. We have also purchased the Super Auto Tomica Building and other Tomica play sets which are wonderful! They are worth the money. The Hot Wheels Super Ultimate Car Garage is over priced, with a slow motorized elevator, malfunctioning gorilla and lacks the bells and whistles. The parking spots aren\u2019t even numbered. That would have added some educational value to this game. My advice: Save you money and look into Tomica\u2019s play sets. You won\u2019t be disappointed.",

This one changes it up a bit, it only has 3 loops and they go upside down instead of more out, and every time they come back through the car flips a lever so it goes into the other track section. The other major change is that when you turn it on, the item itself rotates as well. This means you can line up cars to shoot into the tracks, and have to get the timing just right, otherwise it won't make it in. (You can also fire the car at the switch to stop it all). Getting a couple of cars going makes a nice crash, which of course is the best part. It is fairly large, but packs up a bit easier than other sets. Playability is about the same as the criss cross set, ultimately not a ton of stuff to do with it, but my 5 and 7 year olds still like it. It is loud when on and a car running on it (and of course it takes 4 D batteries, under two screw attached lids).",

You have to launch the cars into the revolution track by hitting a door which is part of one of the loops. If you miss the door, then you have to wait until the track spins around to find the other door. Some cars work better than others, this is the case with all hot wheels tracks, but the most I have had the cars go around is 5 or so times. Then they crash, which is part of the fun, but there is a lot of effort for the enjoyment. It is disappointing when you get cars which have the wrong shape or are too tall and they go around the loop once before falling down. The other thing to watch is to make sure you put good batteries in this toy. Some batteries will lose power quicker which makes the launching wheels move somewhat slower. This matters if you have a heavier car or oddly shaped one as they will be more likely to fall while making the loop.",

One positive to this track set is that smaller pieces do allow you to do some things that the larger track won't let you unless you cut it into smaller pieces. On the other side, I don't think this package is worth buying for three reasons. The first is that you can buy 2 ft. track pieces at Toys 'R Us and you can get about the same amount of track in large piece form for about the same amount of money (minus the car which wasn't that good anyway). The second reason is that these smaller pieces make the track fit together with more track connectors, thus making it more flimsy. The third reason is that the track walls on the track in this set are much shorter than the track walls on the 2 ft. long track pieces that are sold at Toys 'R Us. Overall, I wouldn't say not to buy this, but if you are just looking for lots of track length, save your money and go to Toys 'R Us.",

Also, why don't they make and include curves at all? That would really open up the possibilities a lot. Beyond that, I have no other complaints and my son really enjoys building really long tracks down stairs and off the table and couch etc. It comes with a car and works with non-hot wheels brand cars as well. I even think the price is pretty fair for what you get! I can definitely recommend for kids who like to think BIG when it comes to track layouts, but if you're going to get the most out of it, I definitely recommend buying a high speed curve to supplement.

We were excited to give this to our three-year-old, but unfortunately it turned out to be a horrible toy. There were no instructions for assembly or sticker placement, and on top of that there were no pre-drilled holes for the screws. I finally muscled it together, but Christmas morning my son discovered cars would get stuck at each corner of the track. The Ultimate Garage I got for my ten-year-old was MUCH EASIER to assemble than this, took less time and worked better. We ended up buying our other son a V-tech track to replace this one.",

The car that comes with the playset gets stuck and other cars also get stuck as well, but my 5 year-old honestly does not care. The playset comes assembled with one Hot Wheels car included. There is an arm that pushes the car up the ramp. The arm moves by turning the rim on the top of the playset. The car then goes into the chute and you pull the lever on the big wheel, which shoots the car out a chute on the bottom. The Hot Wheel Super Spin Tire Vehicle Playset can connect to other Hot Wheel City Playsets. Of course, they are sold separately and you will need to purchase tracks to to connect them. No batteries required. It's relatively quiet and keeps my son occupied for hours with his other sets.",

We looked at a few electric tracks, but we figured, well, if he wants to use it someone will have to watch him the whole time, set it up for him, take it down,... just a lot of prep time that we figured would just not get done sometimes. As we were searching, a Hot Wheels track popped up. Man, I had one of those back in the `60`s. I started looking around on Amazon, and found this 4 lane race track. What a cool track! It has 4 lanes, a single start lever,(all lanes start at the same time), and the coolest trick, (besides being able to fold up and carry it like a briefcase), the winner notification. We ordered it right away. Well, when he opened this track up, was he excited! We set it up in about 2 minutes, he was racing about 30 seconds after that. I have to say, this was a very nice purchase. Our daughter called the other day, as we talking we asked where Jak, (not a misspell), was, she said she set his track up for him and he was racing. I`ll agree, this is not the most sturdy track made, but, for a first multi-lane, learning about winning and losing toy, this is an excellent buy. If this is around when our other daughter has a son, well then he just might get one of these tracks for his third birthday.",

(age 5 and 11) They both are still playing with it. Its not flimsy, it is well made, but its not for a 3 year old. (although they can use it, they may keep knocking it over). I would purchase it again if I had to, but not for $80!!! ARE THEY CRAZY!! ITs not worth that, but I love it way more than any hot wheels track set that i've ever purchased for either of my sons! If money is not an option for you, then get it.. i'm sure your child will have endless enjoyment with this toy.

So in other words, the amount that is due should also have the itemized invoice in the following pages in addition to the other active charges.

I'm happy to take them at their word and upgrade my 2 star rating as this really is a great little collectible. This is really a great looking little lamp and very well made too... with one big exception. The battery cover is accessed by removing 4 little jeweler's screws on the diecast rear of the light and those screws thread through 4 little nuts on the back of the plastic battery compartment beneath. The problem is 2 out of 4 of the screws on mine spun freely because the nuts had rounded out their plastic fittings before I even attempted to loosen them. I'm guessing the factory assembly torqued the screws far too hard... which meant I couldn't get the battery cover off. After 30 minutes of prying, pulling, and patience I finally got it loose... spinning one of the nuts all the way through the plastic in the process. It still works, albeit short of two fastening screws, but what an incredibly frustrating experience. I love everything else about it... it's a fantastic little collectible and the accompanying book is very well done as well. I would have called this a bargain at under $20, but it's really too bad their manufacturing quality control isn't on par with all the design work that went into this.",

Not because of Michael Keaton's portrayal as Batman which was a little understated, but because of Jack Nicholson's over the top portrayal of The Joker. He just stole the show. Gotham City was in turmoil until Batman comes on the scene. He cleans up the corruption and crime in his own inimitable way. Michael Keaton's Bruce Wayne characterization was spot on. He was suave and debonair and he and Kim Basinger made a great pair - very classy. The opening scene where Batman confronts two thugs who just robbed a family of their money and jewels is classic. If you want to spend two hours and six minutes with a good action movie, then this is it.",

                "review_text": "If you want the complete Batman score and soundtrack to the classic 1989 movie, then buy this CD (Batman Motion Picture Soundtrack by Prince) and also the Batman Original Motion Picture Score composed by Danny Elfman. This soundtrack by Prince is good, but not worthy of 5 stars. It's 4 stars at best. I used to have this album on vinyl back in 1989. I bought the CD back in 2007. Here are the songs: 1. The Future 2. Electric Chair 3. The Arms Of Orion 4. Partyman 5. Vicki Waiting 6. Trust 7. Lemon Crush 8. Scandalous 9. Batdance My favorite songs are \"Partyman\", \"Trust\", \"Scandalous\", and \"Batdance\". Jack Nicholson's laugh at the beginning of \"Batdance\" at the 0:07 second mark sounds exactly like one of Cesar Romero's laughs from the 1960s TV series, but I don't recall that particular Nicholson laugh being used in any scene in the movie. Romero was a trailblazing and highly influential Joker, so it's possible Nicholson was experimenting with Romero's laugh. The song \"Scandalous\" is played during the closing credits in the movie. I don't know, some of these Prince songs didn't quite fit the movie, yet the stuff is easy to listen to and accept. Just for the record, I like the 1989 Batman movie WAY better than The Dark Knight (2008). The Joker in The Dark Knight, played by Heath Ledger, just wasn't The Joker at all. Instead, it was just some psychopath who was wearing clown makeup. He wasn't funny, he was way too serious (hey, Heath - why so serious?), and above all, Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy in general was just waaaaaaay too serious, thus not permitting The Joker to use the classic Joker gadgets like a hand buzzer and squirting lapel flower. Nolan sucked all the fun out of Batman with his Law & Order/NYPD Blue/CSI feel to the movies. He created such real world settings, yet we have Batman and Rachel Dawes falling 25 stories from a building and not getting killed (in fact, not even injured), we have Harvey Dent walking around with half a face, we have Harvey Dent flipping over a car and not getting injured or killed, we have a horse that breathes fire, we have a mask that has bats flying out of it, I can go on and on and on. The plot holes in all three movies are numerous. Another thing - all I see in these movies are tons of cops, tons of cop cars, cops in riot gear, and SWAT teams galore. If I want to see this kind of stuff, all I have to do is turn on the news, like CNN for example, or watch the above mentioned shows. Basically these movies are crime dramas that happen to include a guy called Batman, which makes a guy who dresses up as a bat look ridiculous and totally out of place. Tim Burton, the director of Batman (1989) and Batman Returns (1992) got it right. His movies were true comic book movies with a comic book feel to them, thus requiring the audience to suspend disbelief. If I see a guy on the screen who dresses up as a bat, I know it's not something in real life, it's something from a comic book movie. If I see somebody in everyday reality dressed as Batman, I can assure you it's only in late October or on the day of a comic book convention. Every time I watch the 2008 movie and then immediately watch the 1989 right after, I always say to myself while I'm watching the 1989 movie, \"Now THIS is a Batman movie. Now THIS is The Joker. Now THIS is Gotham City.\" If I'm going to watch a Batman movie, the movie should allow me to escape reality and entertain me for a couple of hours, not remind me of reality and above all, totally mirror everyday society and take itself so seriously. These are just some of the reasons why Burton's movies are better than Nolan's movies.",

I was wondering how well it would stand the test of time especially against the Christopher Nolan franchise, though the only movie I have seen at this point is \"Batman Begins.\" What I like about Burton's version over Nolan's is that Burton kept a little bit of camp from the TV series (yes I also watched this when it was on television), which gave some relief from the darkness of the film. Most of the camp comes from The Joker's side as Jack Nicholson plays His Joker as a psycho with a huge sense of humor. Michael Keaton play Bruce Wayne/Batman as understated and brooding, with little hints of psycho added to it. Together, they make a much, much darker version of Abbott and Costello. I also loved the look and feel of the 1940's that Tom Burton gave to the film, from the style of clothes that the main character's wore, to the architecture and even phones. It felt as if time had stopped from the moment that Bruce Wayne's parents died. Vicky Vale is the weakest link in this movie. My daughter asked me the next day what Vicky Vale contributed to the film and my reply was \"She could scream musically and she was the set up for the battles between Batman and The Joker.\" This is not to denigrate Kim Basinger's performance, because it was definitely much stronger than Katie Holmes' screen presence in \"Batman Begins.\" However in the big picture, how disappointing that their battles seem to be over a woman (to borrow from Joker's line). She also gave my pre-dating teenaged girls a really good lesson on why sleeping with a man on the first date is a REALLY bad idea. The only character played better on the \"Batman Begins\" was Alfred. That Michael Caine created a better Alfred was an unanimous decision with those of us who had seen both franchises. On the whole, this version has stood up against the test of time pretty well. The one daughter who has seen the Nolan series enjoyed this movie also and appreciated the bit of camp that was thrown into this version. Now I need to finally make time to watch \"The Dark Knight\".",

Watching them again some 25 years later brings back a wave of nostalgia, from getting off school to watching Batman on an old 20\" CRT TV at my grandparents' place, back when all there was to worry about was homework. In those formative years, I didn't appreciate the series the same way I do now. When I played them again on Amazon, I could hardly believe my ears: The title credits started with a bang: Full orchestration! As I dove deeper into each episode, letting the sounds of the orchestra and the voices from my childhood fill the living room, my love and appreciation for the series grows. The voice-acting is just terrific, from the way Batman conveys his moods and feelings to the seductive and voluptuous voices of Catwoman, Harley Quinn, and Poison Ivy, all without detracting from the fact that this was a series made for kids. Adults will still enjoy it. As for me, I will always think of the voice of Batman and the Joker as Kevin Conway and Mark Hamill. To this day, the way the Joker is animated and the way Hamill plays him still sends chills down my spine.",

For newbies to Batman or DC universe, this is the standard that all Batman portrayals should be held to. Sure the plot isn't complicated; you know Batman is going to save the day and catch the bad guy, but that's not what's excellent about the series. It's how true to character the series is. Batman isn't just millionaire playboy who does vigilante work at night. He's a detective. Yes the detective in Detective Comics. Movies don't portray that part of him, but it's what makes him so different from the other superheroes in the DC universe, is his intelligence and sharp instincts. The villains are iconic and Mark Hamil as Joker is such a treat. Goes to show that even if for kids, cartoons don't have to always be cute and bubblegum (like most of CN's shows now). It's dark appeal, mysterious allure, and even feminine seduction is really what makes this show THE Batman that fans have come to love and movie directors try (but fail) to bring to the big screen. Also, the music, opening and background, is FANTASTIC! Really sets the mood. Warner Brothers, Zack Snyder, and CW network, you guys need to go back to these roots and do justice to the characters you guys keep ruining in your movies and TV shows!",

The animation is better-than-average and a bit of a nod to the superb Max Fleischer Superman cartoons from 1941-1943. The art direction (a mix of bauhaus, art deco and futuristic tech) is superb - if only the Batman movies were done just like this series, they would be the greatest super hero movies of all time. *The new intros on some of these episodes - replacing the dramatic opening \"bank heist\" scene and end credits with cheaper, \"Adventures of Batman & Robin\" (which they did for a tie-in into the ill-fated 1997 Joel Schumacher trainwreck) and the straight-up crappy \"Batman & Superman Adventures\" (presumably as a tie-in to the upcoming film or a reference to crossovers that may have happened later) - are a bummer, but they're not on EVERY episode - some retain the original, far superior intro & end credits.",

The show deals with a ton of different enemies from the Batman universe and that is what makes it so fun. The problem solving is fun to watch and the scenery is engrossing, like the comics.

This was always a good looking movie.. but the 4K remaster makes it so much better. Of all discs I've tried, this has to be one of the best. It alternates between the film footage and IMAX footage which just pops off the screen. Grain is pretty minimal, colors and everything are great, but it does look like they raised the shadow detail as the darkest blacks were never quite black (even on an OLED TV). But everything else popped off the screen, especially with the HDR. Highly recommended upgrade. On the audio side we're also looking at DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio (no Dolby Atmos) but it's a good track still. The disc comes with a nice slipcover, the 4K Disc and a Blu-Ray + Special Features as well as a digital copy code. You can also pick this up in the Dark Knight Trilogy which has the same content (but no slipcover) or in the Christopher Nolan 4K Collection (which uses a bulky case to house all 7 Christopher Nolan movies and has no digital copy codes)",

There's nothing about this movie not to like. The returning and new actors are incredible - Heath Ledger as the Joker will make you crazy, but just enough so you can keep watching. Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent will leave you wondering, and his character is developed just enough to make his arc perfect - to keep you wondering but not shocked.

You're probably better off watching Batman Begins first (that is incredible as well) but I don't think it's necessary. You'll just find some of the information new, which is always fantastic. And BTW, no pressure to watch The Dark Knight Rises after this. It's not a bad film but it kind of disappoints.

What makes this even better is exploration of the social-psychology of the uber-vigilante and how good and evil interact and feed off each other, and brutal honesty regarding societal needs and manipulation. This movie series is least appropriate for kids due to the psychological and stark way in which violence is portrayed.",

Liam Neeson and Bale shine in this but also Katie Holmes did a wonderful job too. Don't get me wrong I love The Dark Knight, I thought Heath's role was outstanding and that it will never be duplicated. But Heath carries the movie by himself and Bale isn't nearly as good as he is in Batman Begins. Anyway, Batman Begins shows Bruce Wayne's incredible journey to becoming Batman and ridding society of people who put fear into others. I think its the more emotional movie of the three, it also shows Bruce's fear and determination as a kid to an adult. The quality of this movie in 4k 2160P and the HDR is stunning. The mountain scenes in the beginning and the whole Vietnam scenes really pop out with the colors and detail. No IMAX scenes but the quality is still excellent especially for OLED users. You'll be able to get those natural black scenes which don't look washed. I have a LG OLED C6 65\" TV and it looks incredible. The Audio is DTS HD 5.1 and Dolby Digital 5.1 Unfortunately no Dolby Atmos. I highly recommend this movie especially if you're an OLED owner.",

                "review_text": "First of all, forget your memories of Burton's films of Batman because this is much, much different. Christopher Nolan takes a much darker approach to Batman and tends to swerve farther away from a comic book type feel for the movie. Where Burton often used bright colors and dramatic close ups of caricatures of the infamous DC universe, Nolan takes a more subdued view of the characters and focuses on their psyches instead of their looks and over personalities. Batman Begins, quite literally, spends its time showing the audience just how Bruce Wayne developed his alter-ego and then put that other side of him into effect so that he might make Gotham City a better place. After his father died the city fell into the hands of greedy, biased, and lucrative men who allowed all of the hard work Bruce's father put into the city to fall to the wayside. Constantly filled with anger and hate for the iconic thug that killed his parents and the city's inability to hold itself up, Bruce flees. He searches for something to help him and he finds it in the idea, in the concept, in the teachings of Ra's al Ghul. However, unable to completely follow the definition of \"justice\" presented to him, Bruce returns to Gotham City with specialty training under his belt and a new definition of what he needs to be. What follows is a heart-stopping, action-packed thrill ride that speaks to any fan of the Batman tradition. The main villain here is Scarecrow. Just like Ra's al Ghul, he is not a well-known villain, but he definitely was part and parcel of the comics and deserves his place in the spotlight. More importantly, however, the villain in this movie is based on fear. Fear can control, can infiltrate hate, can skew logic, and can make people weak with the inability to act. Bruce suffered from fear for most of his life which turned into hate and loathing. The people of Gotham City live in fear and distress, unable to lift themselves out of the mire because of that fear. Ra's al Ghul and Scarecrow both use fear to further their means while Batman, Bruce, also taps into the fear well to be used for the better. It is the process of overcoming the psychosis of fear that makes this film so fascinating. It, like the comic books, is something we can relate to and allows us to empathize with the characters. Through this the true story of finding one's identity and fighting fear arises. A great film for the layman and for the comic book connoisseur alike.",

                "review_text": "Batman Begins was the first of the Christopher Nolan Batman trilogy (Batman Begins/Dark Knight/Dark Knight Rises) - this review will be focusing on the 4K Upgrade rather than the movie itself. This was one of the first Blu-Ray's, back when the format was competing against HD-DVD. One of the problems back then is that Warner Brothers used the same video file/bitrate as HD-DVD (which had a smaller disc size, hence a lower bitrate/higher compression was needed to make it fit). The Blu-Ray is also nearing 10 years old at this point, so it's definitely in need of an upgrade. For the 4K release, Christopher Nolan went through and did a full remaster of the release! Unfortunately, and this is possibly due to the way the film was shot, it's very hit-or-miss. Some parts of it look like an obvious upgrade while others are mediocre at best. I will say that this is the best the film has ever looked, but compared to Dark Knight or Dark Knight Rises on 4K.. it leaves some to be desired. For me, the outdoors shots looked great while indoors was a bit disappointing. The HDR, however, is a nice upgrade and probably more noticeable than the clarity. If you've never purchased the Blu-Ray (or if you're just wanting an upgrade), this is the version to get. I just wish they had gone all out with it. On the audio side we're also looking at DTS-HD MA 5.1 audio (no Dolby Atmos) but it's a good track still. The disc comes with a nice slipcover, the 4K Disc and a Blu-Ray + Special Features as well as a digital copy code. You can also pick this up in the Dark Knight Trilogy which has the same content (but no slipcover) or in the Christopher Nolan 4K Collection (which uses a bulky case to house all 7 Christopher Nolan movies and has no digital copy codes)",

This movie version was in theaters during that time but I don't think I ever got around to seeing it and may have seen it when they started issuing movies on VHS, which would have been in the late 70's or early 80's I saw that it's on Amazon Prime so took time to watch it and wow, is it ever dumb.

I remember it being very camp (a stigma that movies about comic book heroes had to endure for some time), but having watched it again last night for the first time in many a year, I found myself laughing at a lot of its outrageous gags (one of my favorites was when they report they are just passing the Benedict Arnold Monument, like someone in America would build a monument to Arnold, LOL). The picture quality for the Blu-ray high def release is excellent, with vibrant colors and the audio is good. There are a number of extras that fill out the disc. There are two commentaries, one by screenwriter Lorenzo Semple, Jr., and the other with Adam West and Burt Ward. There is a short featurette with George Barris, creator of the Batmobile. An interactive map of locations can be played while watching the movie, and while the map spotlights can jump from Santa Barbara (for the wharf where Batman runs with the bomb) to the studio in Culver City where interiors were shot there is an option to pull up factoids, photos, and map directions to the locations. There are featurettes on the heroes and the villains, and more. All in all, a fun Blu-ray disc to purchase.",

Take the entire regular cast of the TV Show, add in the best villains, stir in a romance between Bruce Wayne and Catwoman with a heavy dose of camp and you have Batman: The Movie (1966). ***Spoilers May Occur Below*** When the Joker (Ceasar Romero), Penguin (Burgess Meredith), the Riddler (Frank Gorshin) and Catwoman (Lee Meriwether) join forces to steal a device that will dehydrate anything in order to kidnap the entire United World Central Committee, you know that only Batman and Robin can save the day! Not only do B&R get outwitted a few times, but Bruce Wayne falls for (and almost converts) Catwoman (disguised as Kitka). The regular hi-jinks occurs ending with, you guessed it, Batman and Robin saving the day and the world in the end--even though we do find out that Batman is not perfect in the final return of the Central Committee. Whip out the buttered popcorn, get that giant slurpee, sugar yourself up with a large movie-sized Raisinettes and Milk Duds and lay back in your easy chair to remember what it was like to go to the movies or watch Batman on the daily serialized TV Show.

This time DC got it right with the director and the cast and screen writers. This is the last of the Christopher Nolan and Christian Bale batman movies ending on a epic note and the longgest runing time of all three movies. I love how all three movies mix the best batman story arcs making a begininning a middle and a end. In this epic conculsion they mix the story arc of the Knightfall series and the story of noman's land mixing both stories and making something both epic both a comic book lover and someone just enjoying a movie could love. The characters are just as good has ever ( But maybe not as good as Heath Leager's Joker). Tom Hardy as Bane is so Meneasing and a force to be reckoned with. Batman has finally met his match with Bane and the Batman in this film isnt the bad ass he was in the The Dark Knight. Batman already has his hands full with Bane he also as to deal with the catwoman( Ann Hathaway) but they never say catwoman in the movie. A epic movie to a epic set of films alot of surpises and things you wont see coming or maybe you will. Still one of the best comic book movies ever made along with the Dark Knight and The Man Of Steel. A must see for comic book fans and just plain Batman fans.",

There are definite slower parts in this one but, overall, the story line is excellent and it clocks in at an impressive 2 hours and 45 minutes. Christian Bale, Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman shine as Batman/Bruce Wayne, Alfred and Lucius Fox, respectively. Gary Oldman portrays James Gordon perfectly and Anne Hathaway was beautifully cast as Catwoman/Selina Kyle. For the dark and mercenary Bale (Tom Hardy) my only complaint about him is not his acting, but that he wears a mask and his voice is at times muffled too much and a bit hard to follow/understand. I'll not cover the plot here, as the editorial review (just above the customer review section) does that. Suffice it to say that the plot is excellent and the movie is captivating and should be in collections of anyone who enjoys a great super hero movie (along with \"Batman Begins\" and \"The Dark Knight\"). As a note, the image of the movie case (as of this writing) only says \"Blu-ray Disc,\" but it is a multi-disc package, with the Blu-ray movie disc, the Blu-ray Special Features disc and the DVD movie disc, as well as the UV copy (my code says good until Dec 4, 2014). All of that for just 10 bucks is a fabulous deal. Four-and-a-half stars rounded up. Order. Play. Enjoy!",

                "review_text": "As the slogan said in the previews, TDKR IS an epic conclusion to Nolan's trilogy. I got this for a very cheap price on Cyber Monday (for a friend, I already had it) which kind of felt like I was paying less than what the movie's worth. This is an epic conclusion, and after the The Dark Knight, I was wondering how Nolan would outdo himself. He did. Furthermore, I must comment and say Hans Zimmer outdid himself. When I think of Nolan's Batman movies, the first thing I'll probably think of is Zimmer's memorable themes, and for this one, Bane's theme goes with Bane's menace. For criticisms, I give credit to \"How it should have ended\" - a humorous website the picks on movies... but there's a scene when Wayne returns to Gotham after a long exile, and to showcase his return to Bane, all we see is a skyscraper with the shape of a Bat on the side. Humorously, I must know, why did Wayne think that sort of project was worthwhile while the city, including his new love interest, is being held captive? Obviously the response will be to give hope to people that Batman is back, and give fright to the enemy. In any case, not entirely important. Nolan raises the stakes higher in this film, and isn't afraid to pick on movie-goer's nerves and put the main characters to their limits, and even break a few Batman-mythos rules in the process. The result is Batman more real then he's ever been. It IS an epic conclusion.",

Bane\u2019s voice, the way they use the camera to make Bane fill the lens is awesome. Catwoman is dope too. I think Anne Hathaway is dead sexy baby, yeah. I\u2019m not sure if the Batman movies will ever be redone. Maybe never, maybe not for a long time, maybe soon. Who knows. That said, this is an a great ending to a new style. Well played Mr. Nolan.

                "review_text": "Having never seen the original graphic novel, I have to say I was highly impressed by this adaptation. It's three hours long of pure, compressed awesome as Batman makes a comeback in Gotham City with a vengeance. And while he is older, Batman has lost none of his skills and determination, settling old scores one by one. Aside from strong action sequences, the movie also has some powerful themes running through it, particularly how it satirizes our media and way of life. Batman's activities and those of his enemies are commented on by a 24/7 news circus, led by a variety of talking heads that are all too often very opinionated but completely clueless. Far from dated, that commentary seems more relevant than ever. Today we live in a 24/7 news cycle, bombarded with information, but most of it's useless at best, misleading at worst. Another theme is authority figures abdicating said authority by failing to act when it's needed. Only Batman is willing to make the hard choices that will keep other people safe and restore order, but unfortunately this, more than anything else, makes him public enemy #1. Is it appropriate to resort to vigilantism when our leaders fail us, or is it better to stand by them for the sake of public order? Batman seems to prefer the former, and it's hard to argue with the results. The characters in the movie are all very interesting, with striking visual designs. The Mutants are a bunch of savages that babble slang from behind the multitudinous neon red glow of their visors, and led by a monstrous leader that probably is, in fact, a mutant. The Joker, in contrast to his usual lanky, disheveled appearance, looks nearly unphased by age and seems stronger than ever. There's Carrie, the girl Robin, who adds a desperately needed splash of bright color to Gotham's grim world, and her enthusiasm is infectious. And of course, there's the Batman, whose strong jaw and muscular bulk mark him as a force to be reckoned with. The voice-overs are all top-notch, too. The Joker's lines are delivered with an unnerving, almost feminine tone as he gleefully rampages about. Peter Weller's Batman is great, too. I know some people would want Kevin Conroy but Weller is just fine, here. This Batman needed to be someone who could come off as both a thinker and a leader, and Weller's strong voice pulled that off, though I have to admit that, when he said, \"I am the law!\" I couldn't help but get Robocop flashbacks. It's not entirely perfect, though. While the animation is good, some of the special effects, especially fog or smoke, look cheap and out of place beside the animated characters. I also felt the movie was way too hard on \"President,\" who's obviously supposed to be Reagan--and the irony is that, while it was cool to poke fun at Reagan back then, these days, well after the publication of the original graphic novel, politicians from both parties are quick to try and compare themselves to him. So much for that bit of satire. And you may find this movie portrays some classic characters in ways you might be unused to, to say the least. Some scenes, especially with Superman and the Joker, are very disturbing, and I would even go so far as to say Heath Ledger's Joker was restrained compared to the one we have here. The movie caps off with a few hours of documentaries, but while some of them are fairly interesting, they can be safely skipped, because otherwise you're looking at a five hour movie--geeze! Hey, DC! How about a sequel, huh? Because The Dark Knight Strikes Again was... uh... well... hm. You know what, let's leave this saga at this satisfying conclusion. Frank Miller probably should have.",

Along the way he goes up against the likes of Two Face, Joker, and of course, Superman. What makes this film so extraordinary besides the stellar voice cast is that it truly provides an excellent insight into the psyche of Batman. It also has an epic score with an incredible main theme. The animation is also top notch with several standout scenes showing just how brutally effective the vigilante still is in his old age. This is the story that Batman v Superman drew heavily on, so if you liked that interpretation of Batman, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie. Superman is also really well portrayed and has none of his self doubt issues from Dawn of Justice. As the headline states, I truly believe this is the best Batman film ever made, animated or otherwise.",

These two movies (which don't break in between) were, together, the best batman movies I'd ever seen. He's not a clean cut superhero, but he does what he has to do. He's clever, witty, ingenious - just perfect. SPOILER ALERT : The Arrow makes an appearance, and so does the Joker. Watch this one through. It will make you wonder why these few animated DC gems aren't the ones released into theaters, and the terrible live action ones are. It wasn't perfect, but for those of you who have somewhat kept up with the Batman's story (like myself) will find this movie to be a sort of closure to his legacy. I thoroughly enjoyed it and I hope you will too. This puts the new dc 52 movies to shame. In fact I plan to never watch any of them unless they can top or match this movie set; a well-spent $14.99.",

I find that there are only two camps when it comes to the old Batman TV series: either you love it, or you hate it. There doesn't seem to be any middle ground. Yes, it's campy. Yes, it's cheesy. No, the writers were never going to win an award for tight dialogue and engrossing mysteries. But if you liked it way back when, watching the '66 Batman is like a stroll down memory lane. I probably owe my love a Batman, and superheroes in general, to the reruns of this show that I watched every afternoon during the 90s. Having the first season on DVD is loads of fun, and I can't wait until my son is old enough to watch it with me.",

You can see in the photos that this clearing didn't snap off and it wasn't broken off...it literally looks melted and corroded....I can't believe a coffee mug was melted by hot coffee! Who makes a coffee mug with a mouth piece that can't handle hot coffee? I am so upset because I love this mug and spent a little extra to show off my nerdy side and now it's fallen apart after 6 months and very little use.

I love the weight of it and the solid rubber outer sleeve does a stellar job keeping beverages at exactly the temperature you desire for long drives. Recently I drove 300 miles and every refill of coffee remained hot to very warm for well over an hour 1/2 each time. The raised design includes the Bat-symbol and a series of grips that are all made of the same soft rubber as the rest of the sleeve. They are not hard so your fingers will not feel funky when gripping this mug to sip. The slide opening provides amble space for your bev to flow and the airflow is good eliminating any liquid slow down due to minimal aeration. The top/lid screws into place and seals incredibly well with no dripping or spills. Cleaning is a breeze under hot, soapy water with a soft brush or dish mop. I would not recommend placing in a dishwasher due to the chance of moister seeping in between the sleeve and the metal cup. The sleeve fits very snugly, but I just wouldn't trust it in a machine. The Paladone Batman Travel Mug is perfectly priced for the quality and I highly recommend it for any Batman fan who has to have their morning cup o' java before even thinking about fighting crime for the day.",

Right from the opening credits, which cleverly intertwine the old 66 Batman television show with historic Batman comic book covers, one can immediately tell this animated film will not disappoint. The movie at its core is brilliant, using witty dialog and spectacular animation to entertain the viewer from start to finish. There are tons of Easter Eggs throughout that will satisfy the appetite of longtime fans. The Batcave\u2019s decor is a great mix of Batman comics through the years and the tv show for which the film is based on. All items are woven together quite nicely. The story itself is not complex, but the manor it\u2019s presented extremely creative. The voice acting is a nice mix of the classic actors themselves (which include Adam West, Burt Ward and Julie Newmar) along with others, which do a great job with the iconic characters. The true shining moment of this movie is the animation itself, which is pure eye candy! I\u2019m amazed how incredible the lighting and colors burst on my HD screen. Why can\u2019t all DC Animated films be this engaging? I highly recommend Batman: Return of the Caped Crusaders! FINAL GRADE = A",

Fans of the classic Batman TV show will be delighted that all the classic gags and moments are faithfully included. Climbing a wall? Check. Onomatopoeias? Check. Absurd scenarios and puns? You know it! That said, this movie has its own story to tell. If they just reproduced the TV show beat for beat, it would probably still be pretty good, but as the film progresses it transforms into something really meaningful that uses the original show as a springboard for its own important message. I can't really go into the specifics of what makes this story so special without spoiling the greatest parts, but this is a smart, even introspective film made real passion. Animation-wise, this is a beautiful movie. I was worried how a straight-to-disc movie would look on the big screen, but I think this honestly could have been a regular theatrical release\u2014 the images are bold, beautiful and deserve to be seen on the largest screen possible. The likenesses of the classic actors have been captured brilliantly, the animation is smooth, and the artstyle is gorgeous. Gotham city manages to look like the Gotham of the classic TV show, but has that art-deco look DC's animated productions are known for. That the movie is animated also allows the story to do wonderful, insane things that are far beyond what the budget or special effects of the show could do in live action, but still feel true to the kind of things that would happen if the original production had the resources. Finally, the voice actors. Everyone is great! You can definitely hear the age in Adam West and Julie Newmar's voice (Burt Ward sounds the same as ever!), but everyone brings energy and heart to the table. The deadpan delivery of absurd dialogue that made the original so endearing is fully intact and makes for some excellent jokes. The non-returning cast do a great job imitating the original actors, and Wally Wingert in paticular is dead-on as the Riddler. Overall, this is a smart, beautiful, fun movie that will remind you of why we love classic Batman so much. This is a way more entertaining and engaging film than either of Batman's live action efforts this year. I've been rough on DC this year, but they really knocked this one out of the park.",

The writers channeled Lorenzo Semple Jr. perfectly. The voice acting was great. The 3 returning stars know the roles inside and out by now, and the voices and mannerisms were spot-on for the newcomers, with the exception of the Penguin. To be fair, Burgess Meredith's voice seems like it would be the hardest to emulate, and I think the VA who did the Penguin did a good but not great job at the start of the film. Towards the end of the movie he seemed to get better at it, and if you watch the special features, he completely nails it when he does his Penguin voice in an interview. If Pengy returns in another one of these films I think he'd sound just like Burgess Meredith next time around. I was very impressed at how much the Joker sounded like Cesar Romero, and even more impressed by how well Wally Wingert captured Frank Gorshin's voice and mannerisms. There was only one thing I really didn't like about the movie, and that was the Joker's fart gag. There's no way Cesar Romero would have let his Joker do that, he had way too much class. I hope that the writers resist the urge to throw in gags like that in future installments. Two nit-picks I have are the lack of a white mustache on the Joker, and the Tyrannosaurus Rex statue in the Batcave. I don't mind that they added a T-Rex to the Batcave per se, but I wish they had used a more period-appropriate version. The '60s view of a T-Rex would have stood upright; it wasn't until the late 1980s that the modern view of T-Rex came about, with its spine parallel to the ground. Anyway, I hope to see more of these, and would love it if it became a regular TV series.",

                "review_text": "I remember seeing the theatrical release of Batman vs Superman and genuinely enjoying it despite its faults, but still feeling like something was missing. And when the negative reviews began pouring in, I felt more than a little guilty about my opinion that the film was an entertaining (if somber) motion picture. Soon thereafter I received word of an extended release and hoped that it would provide that little bit which I felt was missing from the version that I saw twice in theaters... It absolutely delivered. This version provides that little element of heart that was unfairly cut out of the cinematic release, appropriately provided by the character with the biggest heart of them all: Superman. From calling up his mother in the middle of the night to seek guidance and emotional support, to going against his boss's instructions to shed light upon the people who are being hurt by Batman's vigilantism, and consistently helping others in spite of being distrusted and rejected by an unappreciative world who sees him only as a loose cannon (Anti-MoS fanboys, anybody?), this Superman provides the most human element of the story in this, THE definitive version of Batman vs Superman. In fact I find it very hard to regard him as the dark and violent sadist that the detractors of these DC movies see him as, considering that he does pretty much nothing to warrant such a label... that honor goes to Ben Affleck's dark, twisted, and unforgiving portrayal of Batman. Speaking of, Batman is undoubtedly the single biggest reason to see this movie. After three solid films by Christopher Nolan which depicted a semi-dark but overall heroic (and dare I say, unintimidating) version of the dark knight, Zack Snyder's take on the caped crusader gives us an interesting portrayal the likes of which we've never really seen before, borrowing heavily from Frank Miller's seminal graphic novel The Dark Knight Returns. This Batman is an old and broken man, bitterly stubborn and Hell-bent on bringing down Superman, no matter what the cost. And I DO mean that in the most drastic of terms, for it seems that Batman's 20-year reign of terror has left him indifferent to the lives of criminals; at one point in the film during an exciting chase scene, for instance, we see the Batmobile snag a car holding some thugs and use it to dispatch a second car, no doubt killing virtually everyone inside of both vehicles in the process. But unlike in Tim Burton's duology, Christopher Nolan's films, and even Joel Schumacher's \"Batman Forever\" (wherein we see Batman remorselessly kill three thugs, a buttload of ninjas, The Joker, The Penguin, Two-Face (twice), Ra's Al Ghul, AND Talia Al Ghul), this time around we're given a look at Bruce's psychology as well as some clues to give us an idea of why this version of Batman is so cruel and harsh towards criminals. It's... honestly surprising that people give this film such a hard time about Batman's \"killing spree\" when this is absolutely NOT breaking any new ground with him. But hey, could be worse; he could be making out with Black Canary while some criminals burn to death nearby. *Cough*(All-Star Batman)*Cough* Now that I've covered both of the main stars, I'd like to briefly cover the titular fight which everyone paid to see. Put simply, it's a satisfyingly brutal bout between two titans of the genre that have never shared the screen before. Batman's mechanical armor from The Dark Knight Returns is beautifully recreated in live action, and I'm glad to say that it was largely a practical effect rather than a CGI costume (ala Iron Man) and as a result, it feels appropriately bulky, intimidating, and powerful. I WAS somewhat disappointed that it didn't grant Batman any enhanced strength, merely serving instead as a means by which Batman may take the brunt of Superman's strength without harm, but at the very least it serves its purpose very well. Both characters give it their all, and without spoiling how the fight actually ends it stands as the emotional peak of the movie. (Yes, fanboys, I liked how the fight ended... for a detailed analysis as to why, and with no restraint on spoilers, I refer you to CinemaWins' spectacular video \"Everything Great About Batman Vs Superman\") This summarizes my major plus-points about the overall experience. I do, however, take issue with the climax of the film. That is not to say that it doesn't deliver exactly what it sets out to; it IS explosive and action-packed, with appropriately epic visuals and a suitably intimidating and powerful villain, but honestly after the spectacular fight between Batman and Superman (which I was far more invested in) the final battle simply bored me. It DOES end on a surprising note, however, which I shan't spoil here (although anybody who's familiar with the source material this film was based on might be able to wager a reasonable guess). Plus we finally got to see Wonder Woman in action for the first time ever in a major big-screen motion picture, so there's also that plus. Believe it or not, I'm one of those few people who is just fine with Jesse Eisenberg's Lex Luthor; I mean he's not the calm and collected mastermind we saw in the Superman and Justice League animated series, but I liked him well enough. At the very least his plan was deeply complicated, he seemed to have contingencies for just about everything, AND he has some of the best lines in the film. So it's a mixed bag; either you love him or you hate him. Overall I give this movie a 4 out of 5. Too many people have forgotten just how lucky we are to even have this thing; 10 years ago it would never have even been conceivable, yet now because of Marvel's super happy fun time superhero movies (which I should mention I am also quite fond of) we've become spoiled and ungrateful for what we have. This film attempts to be different than Marvel's straightforward super-fare by offering a thought-provoking analysis of Superman and what it would really be like to have such a powerful being in our modern world of cynicism and distrust, and the fans took one look at it and went \"why can't it be all fun and happy like Marvel's doing??\" and refused to appreciate the movie's good points, of which there are many. To me, this film stands not only as an outstanding Batman/Superman movie as well as a monolith of just how far we've come in the medium of superhero movies as a whole. Thank you, Zack Snyder, for this monumental achievement. I'm proud to own your imperfect masterpiece here on Amazon.",

Imagine I traveled to a planet where the inhabitants were about the weight and consistency of styrofoam peanuts, and I spent my time kicking them to and fro for my own reasons. Would that make me virtuous, would it make me super? And even if I did it with the best of intentions, wouldn't they have every reason to fear me? And how could I assure them, how could I assure myself I would be the one person in history immune to the absolute corruption of absolute power? It is problematic, and I appreciate this movie dealing with the problematic nature of the \"superhero\" issue. Spoiler alert: I disagree with those who criticize the hard turn the movie takes when Batman and Superman resolve their difference seemingly over their mothers' shared name. For one, Batman relents when he understands Superman's motivation is to protect his mother --- the shared name is merely a device to catch his attention. For obvious back-story reasons, Batman is highly motivated by the possibility that Superman could fail to protect his mother, and that's the *substantive* reason he decides to help him rather than fight him. I do think the conflict could still be carried forward with an only uneasy truce between Batman and Superman. That would make for a better story, both dramatically and, in my opinion, philosophically. That quibble aside, this movie, in contrast to almost every superhero movie, has well-written, natural-sounding dialog, fewer \"cinema sins\", almost-perfect casting, compelling acting, and truly beautiful imagery that is a breed apart from the overly-filtered awkward CGI of so many movies like this. I'm deeply surprised that it has received such poor reviews when other movies that I've found almost unwatchable have received near-universal praise.",

Haters will likely still hate it, but I know I'm more than satisfied now with this ultimate cut. Update: After watching Wonder Woman recently, I wanted to go back and watch this film again to see any new revelations that could be grasped. Let's just say that the look of familiar despair on Diana's face at the end of the climatic battle with Doomsday took on a whole new weight after her film showed us her experiences with loss. The BvS ending was even more of a gut punch on this viewing and I found myself getting emotional just as I did during Wonder Woman.

I figured, screw it, it's only 10 bucks, and it's not like I'm buying it to really use it, it's more a decoration, so I took the risk. I opened it up, and it was perfect. No dings or tool marks, both blades are sturdy and open smoothly. It's also surprisingly comfortable to hold, considering how chunky the hilt is. Perfect for any batman fan, or anyone who like off stuff. And again...it was ten dollars, definitely worth it.",

I've watched it more than 5 times during my rental period and can't seem to get enough of the \"Let's Get Nut's\" Batman song in the beginning of the movie. As for whether or not it's for kids, I'll leave these comments as this is coming from a 37 year old: I didn't think it was any more or less violent than Despicable Me or Monsters University. However, my young ones didn't understand many references made in the movie despite finding it enjoyable. Specifically, there are many references (hilarious ones or hilariously spun) that are either before many 10 year old's time, are from movies that were not for children, or are not part of US pop culture. For example, \"You wanna get nuts?! Let's get nuts!\" is from the 1989 Batman movie (I was 9 when that movie came out...and yes I watched it and didn't understand it until I watched it again as an adult). The Eye of Sauron is from Lord of the Rings, a PG-13 movie. Or the Daleks from Dr. Who (NIIIIIICE!!), which are awesome but part of British pop culture. ELIMINATE! ELIMINATE! ELIMINATE! ...yes, I am a closet Whovian. I'm sure the adults appreciate the homage to the 1960's Batman (rest in peace Adam West) as represented by Alfred's batsuit and the underlying theme song. Also the \"Pow!\" and other visual fight sounds were enjoyable. The humor was on point! I loved the sarcasm and indirectly making fun of...Batman. \"'Puter! Overcompensate!\" \"What is the password?\" \"Ironman sucks!\" I'm not always into these types of movies, but I thought it was honestly brilliant. Brilliantly written and just a bowl of laughs!",

I like the message it sends- its like a family is more important than anything else message and work together and you can make the world a better place message.

There are jokes in the movie that only adults will get but nothing crude so it is suitable for the whole family. It left me with a big smile on my face and that is what I want in the summer, to be lazy and watch silly & funny movies.

That's the first 30 minutes. None of that bothers me in the slightest because I'm a 30 year old man but it felt worth mentioning for the sake of parents, since this is in a similar style to other more kid friendly Batman series'. Other than that, it's definitely not the best, not the worst. Harleys voice is pretty grating. I mean, it always is, but it seems more noticeable since it's not Tara Strong or Arleen Sorkin, whose particular pitch many of us have gotten used to. I don't have much else to say, it's a pretty standard adventure, I probably wouldn't watch it a second time.",

I missed Arlene Sorkin as Harley. Melissa Rauch does a decent job, but her Harley is SO much more abrasive than Sorkin's. And to be honest, that kind of sums up this whole movie. It has moments of sweetness, and belly-laugh comedy. It also has odd musical sequences and some Easter Eggs for fans of old BTAS. But it has some really crude humor. And several times I thought \"I cannot believe they just did that.\" This isn't just the kind of show that I'd have to watch with my kids. Frankly, I wouldn't feel comfortable letting my kids watch it. In fact, I turned it off when they came in the room. I never had to do that with BTAS.

I decided since it was time to shop for a new toaster that I would downgrade from my large 4-slice toaster to a quaint 2-slice toaster to gain some counter space. I saw this little baby on Amazon and it caught my eye, plus the price was awesome, under $16. The color and graphics are just as bright and cheery in \"person\" as it looks in this picture. A nice rich red with Mickey looking at toward the slice slots, keeping an eye on your food for you. The settings are pretty accurate as far as how dark or light you prefer your toast. The coolest part is that it leaves a Mickey Mouse head-shaped outline on one side of your toast. Since it totally toasts one side, it doesn't taste like untoasted bread in those areas on the other side. The slots are large enough for bigger items like bagels, which makes it useful for all types of breakfast foods and snacks. At first, I was going to list this as a negative, but luckily I was wrong. My old toaster had a CANCEL button, which worked most of the time. This Mickey Toaster does not. Instead, you turn the setting knob all the way to the left, and this cancels your toasting. So far it works every single time I've tried it. It seems that this toaster, although I have to wait to toast my bread items when I have more than two to toast, it toasts much quicker than my earlier model. I love that it toasts so quickly, there's nothing worse than waiting for toast. THE BAD One thing that I don't like is that the toaster almost feels like a toy. Despite the fact that it toasts so well, it is very light and therefor a bit cheap-feeling. But having said this, I feel like this is something that I'd get used to kind of quickly. Overall - I love this toaster. Guests comment on its good looks. If they receive toast, they gush over the Mickey Head shape. I recommend this to fans of Disney and toasted bread everywhere.",

What I mean by that is at the lowest setting you have to push it down twice for regular toast, you can't turn it up even one or it gets burnt. And with store baked bread, as in the kind you by uncut loafs of like the french bread, you can only push it down once and then have to let it sit in there. Also, the mickey label doesn't always show, unless its a bit crispy. Now don't get me wrong, I love this toaster, its absolutely wonderful for the price and I love the design.",

                "review_text": "by a twist of an atypically benevolent Fate, Adam West lived just long enough to send his best and most beloved role out in a certain amount of style. his portrayal was as ethical yet winsome as ever, and despite being noticeably thinned by age, his voice had lost none of it's heroic authority. also along for the ride are Burt \"Robin\" Ward and Julie \"Catwoman\" Newman, both of whom simimarly retain the thrust that made their characters resonate. based upon a revivalist comic-book series, the goal here was clearly to find a middle-ground between the whimsy of West's tv series and the grittier version(s) of more recent years. for the most part they did an impressive job. it has both the grandeur of Batman's more recent cartoons and the freewheeling sense of humor of West's heyday. for instance, at one point Batman is clonked on the head and briefly sees triple, and the two addition Catwomen are caricatures of fellow former Catwomen Lee Meriwether and Eartha Kitt. or take the legal precedent cited of \"Dozier Vs. Semple.\" obviously this refers to William Dozier, producer/narrator of the original series, and Lorenzo Semple Jr., author of many episodes. once or twice, it might even be too clever for it's own good. Robin's exclamation of \"Holy Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\" is plenty amusing in context, but i fear it will leave the overanalysts scratching their heads. after all, how could that paragon of wholesome, The Boy Wonder, possibly know about Russ Meyer movies? some key actors, alas, were shortsighted enough to die before the project was even envisioned, leaving us to settle for imitators. not that they do at all poorly: the voices behind The Joker and The Riddler do an admirable job of replicating the essences of Caesar Romero and Frank Gorshin, but whoever plays The Penguin falls so laughably short of Burgess Meredith, one wonders if he's actually even trying. i've said before and i'm prepared to say again that The Penguin is easily the corniest nemesis i've ever seen Batman (or any other superhero) come up against...unless he's in the form of Burgess Meredith. God knows how Meredith managed to transcend the limited character he had to work with, but somehow he did, making all Penguins to come (not least of which Danny DeVito) that much harder to take seriously. add the fact that character acts as part of a gang rather than doing anything on his own account, and it becomes all too unmissable: The Penguin is present strictly for the Marquee value, less because he actually contributes something than because he was expected. the rest of the cast does a pretty good job. Aunt Harriett sounds just like Madge Blake, although curiously isn't drawn to look much like her. and Alfred remains the loyal, lovable right-hand man of old. which is all the more impressive when one learns he's played by, of all people, Steven Weber from Wings. they didn't manage to rekindle all the classic tropes, i'm afraid. there are exotic death traps but obviously no cliffhangers. there are no special guest cameos in the window when they scale a building. nor is there any sign of Batgirl. (presumable because Yvonne Craig had shuffled her own mortal coil not long before.) but fortunately there's only one omission for which the whole actually suffers: no glib narrator to take over for producer Bill Dozier. Return Of The Caped Crusaders, title notwithstanding, effectively picks up where we left off. the plot concerns a concoction of Catwoman's - which she terms \"Batnip\" - designed to relieve our hero of any conscience or ethics. it turns out to work more gradually than she was counting on, but it does ultimately manage to make a monster out of him. things officially get really hairy when he uses the story's resident McGuffin, the \"Replication Ray,\" to reproduce corrupted Batmans (Batmen?) by the seemingly hundreds. then comes Batman Vs. Two-Face, which, in the classic \"special guest villain\" mode, features William Shatner in the antagonist role. he's even drawn to not-so-subtly resemble Captain Kirk. this could be a case of wish fulfillment, because a semi-legendary unproduced episode would've featured Harvey Dent and his Mr. Hyde in the '60s. the \"treatment\" for said episode was by noted science-fiction author Harlan Ellison, who, perhaps coincidentally, also wrote Shatner's favorite Star Trek exploit, \"The City On The Edge Of Forever.\" one of the coolest angles here is a promise followed up on. a prison break scene from Return features glimpses of many of the villains from the series, but doesn't really do anything with them. the Two-Face movie actually begins to work them into the foreground, giving underused foes King Tut and Bookworm brief but juicy role in the central action. one can only surmise what further installments would've had in mind for Egghead, Shame, Siren, and/or Mr. Freeze. one nifty in-joke concerns the lawyer who's identity Catwoman escapes prison by assuming, complete with a swapping of outfits. this hapless is soul is played the aforementioned Lee Meriwether, who stood in when Juile Newmar was unavailable for the Batman movie in 1966. perhaps most significantly, recent events allowed the credits to set one record straight. i've mentioned before how the \"dark knight\" version of Batman is little more than a plagiarism of The Shadow, but it turns out that was only the beginning of alleged creator Bob Kane's perfidy. it turns out that he wasn't really a writer so much as an artist, and was \"helped\" more than a little by one Bill Finger. it seems the man dressed as a bat was pretty much the extent of Kane's contribution. everything else - the dead parents backstory, most of the rogue's gallery, even the name \"Batman\" - are courtesy of Finger, but due to some contractual hocus-pocus, Kane got sole credit for decades. Kane was never likely to personally rectify the situation, given that he turned out to be a hammy limelight junkie, a' la Paris Hilton or Zsa Zsa Gabor. it was only around 2010 that efforts were taken on Finger's behalf to secure the credit he deserved, and while the campaign proved difficult and time consuming, it was successful in time for these films, and the tv show Gotham, to be able to officially sight Bill Finger's contribution. by an interesting historical footnote, the one piece of Batman for which Finger managed in his lifetime to claim official credit - \"The Clock King's Crazy Crimes\"/\"The Clock King Gets Crowned\" - is an Adam West episode. but i digress... it might feel incomplete, because it was meant to be a longer series. Adam West was taken from us before it could be taken any father. of course there's always the possibility that they'll recast the role, and who knows, maybe they'll find someone who can adequately replicate his essence. but then, maybe not. be that as it may, rest in peace, Adam. not Michael Keaton, not George Clooney, not even Christian Bale could even begin to take your place. if, in the words of Queen (and/or Highlander), there can be only one, it's you, Adam.",

                "review_text": "As a kid, I started watching the 1966 Batman TV show via reruns in the early 1970s. We didn't know the dark, brooding, violent Batman back then, only the over-the-top campy fun of what they now term \"the Bright Knight\". We loved that as kids. While I do enjoy more modern, darker interpretations, I feel there's a place in history for both, and I'm thrilled that we were given one last romp with the TV cast. This movie nails the look and feel of the live-action TV show in all its glorious silliness, right down to wall walking, and the headgear on the evil draining machine looking like cheezy prop recycling of 1960s salon hair dryers. The movie creators clearly know it is ridiculous and play it for additional laughs. Just look at some of the crazy signage in the background of the climactic struggle. An old fan can also appreciate some of the meta jokes, such as some things that happen with Lee Meriweather's character. Burt Ward was really on top of his voice role, sounding like a college student much of the time. But the real treasure was bringing Bill Shatner in for the Harvey Dent role. As soon as I heard it announced during production of the movie, I cheered. Shatner awesomely handled a dual role before in Star Trek's \"Wolf In The Fold\" episode, so I knew the character was in great hands, and he delivered as expected. I wistfully wish this had been a second live-action Batman movie back in the 1960s just to have Shatner act it. I'd also add that it was great of the writers to bring back two of my favorite 1960s villains to flesh out the full story. Again, I'd only wish this would have been the old live action to have Victor Buono and Roddy McDowell reprise their roles. There were actually several of the TV show villains cameoed throughout, some with minor speaking roles. The only thing I wrinkled my nose at was the inclusion of the Otto Preminger version of Mr. Freeze, the weakest of three actors who played the role on TV. I would have preferred either of the other actors, Eli Wallach or George Sanders, as the template for the animated cameo. Lastly, this film also marks the first (and sadly, only) appearance of two other prominent Batman villains in the 1960's canon. Look for them when the testing room first fills with villains. One of them is a cameo (with a bit more air time in the Blue Ray version) with a very distinctive accent, and the other fills a more substantial role. If you're one of the younger generation of viewers who don't seem to get the campy fun of the 1960s, don't bother watching. You'll only be miffed and rate it a 1-star (which it is not). But if you don't mind letting go of a host of dark-and-brooding pre-conceptions and are willing to embrace a lot of zany fun, then grab a bowl of popcorn and sit back with a friend for a great time.",

I am a huge fan of both Batman and Sherlock Holmes, so seeing the two world's collide was quite a treat. The characters were all likable, still keeping the base components of their original personalities intact but also fitting their different time period and circumstances well enough to evolve into their new roles. The voice acting and story were solid, and i enjoyed trying to deduce the story right along with the characters (why I love mysteries and detective stories). My biggest complaints probably fell on the animation. I was fine with the art resembling the old Batman Animated series I knew and love, but the backgrounds often felt cheap and the random bits of CG that were poorly integrated were eye catching and not in a good way. At least I loved the character designs. Seeing everyone in the Victorian garb was great and the fight scenes where nicely done and surprisingly graphic and violent which I think perfectly fit the movies mood and kept things moving at a nice exciting pace.",

                "review_text": "Batman Gotham by Gaslight is an animated movie based on the elseworlds story of the same name Gotham by Gaslight. Where Batman is taken to the late 19th century Gotham to fight one of history notorious killers Jack the Ripper. The Animated movie is not a direct adaptation of the comic, so the identity of Jack the Ripper has been completely redone from the comic as well as the overall stories. Gotham by Gaslight does an excellent job incorporating many of the Batman characters who weren\u2019t in the original comic. They fit in well with the source material, especially the three Robins Dick, Jason, and Tim. With them being cleverly designed as these street beggars. On the opposite you have Catwoman, Selina Kyle who felt ham-fisted throughout the plot. Catwoman is the replacement of Julie Madison who was the original love interest in the comic. I understand the replacement as Catwoman is the more well-known love interest but the way they shoved her in at times that felt force and killed the pacing. Aside from that Catwoman is incorporated well to the plot. Voice Acting was well done Bruce Greenwood returns as Batman does a great job, Jennifer Carpenter played a great Catwoman. The film is not shy about showing blood as the Ripper scenes are straight out of a horror film earning it a rated R rating. The Animation is the biggest flaw of the movie that holds it back while I can praise the Art style for nailing the Steampunk Batman look especially at night. The animation leaves more to be desired awkward movements and bizarre transitions to 3D animation left me disappointed on how far DC has become lazy. The look and style are great as mentioned before it does nail down the comic book aesthetic but in motion not so much. At the end Batman Gotham by Gaslight was enjoyable. It did the Jack V. Batman better than the original comic. It incorporated most characters in an organic fashion. It brought a 19th century Batman and his Steampunk inspired tech. One of DC\u2019s better Batman films not as great as the older ones but not as bad the newer ones. It\u2019s a Steampunk Batman fighting Jack the Ripper! A must watch for fans of The Batman.",

That said, I like this story a little better. Here the outcome and the nemesis is less predictable than the graphic novel. In a way, this reminds me of Justice League Gods and Monsters where the creative team gave themselves the freedom to mix up the cast, the origins, and the outcomes. I have to admit to a little hypocrisy in that while I like the fact the creative team confounded expectations, Batman not being voiced by Kevin Conroy was a bit distracting. In short, if you have your heart set on seeing a slavishly faithful translation of the original graphic novel, you will be disappointed. But if, like the movie audiences of old, you confine your expectations to the feel of the original and leave yourself open to a plot that going in a truly interesting direction, you are in for a strong story.",

When we prompted him to speak deeper it actually did well with sounds more Batman like, but most kids are not going to achieve that affect. However they will definitely achieve a strange voice and they will love that anyway. So a win for that. He also likes the built in sounds and that the mask is heavier duty than others he has owned. This make makes him think it is a toy for grown-ups, not for kids, which makes it cooler. It was also nice that the batteries were included in this so it worked right out of the box. He is already planning to wear this for Halloween since the voice changer is so much fun and can be creepy, too. This is a kid who ADORES masks and cosplay.

                "review_text": "At the outset, let me say that we are very much an Imaginext family. Ever since my ten-year-old was a toddler, we have been collecting bits and pieces from a variety of interchangeable Imaginext sets. We love the fact that the figures all work together across different playsets, so there are big opportunities for creative play. We have more Batman sets and figures than any other, but we love to combine them with our other Imaginext toys: Jurassic World, Power Rangers, Monsters Inc., city and space sets. We have an older Bat Cave playset in our collection, and at first we thought that this would be an unnecessary duplicate. But in fact, this \"Wayne Manor\" set actually works very well as a companion piece to the more elaborate Bat Cave we have separately. Wayne Manor is very gothic and castle-like, with a lot of dark plastic rock work. We love the plastic waterfall that can open and close, and the pop-up and light-up Bat Signal is just awesome and the exact kind of feature I would have wanted on a Bat Cave toy when I was a kid. The spin-around glider is a nice feature, though not quite as interesting since it only goes in a circle, and the now-standard Imaginext disc launcher and jail cell are pretty much mandatory in any action playset of this size. We were pleased to see a Bat Cycle included here, even though we already have a couple, and the Batman figure is somewhat different than our (older) ones from other sets. I don't quite understand why Batman comes with a huge sword, but my kids certainly enjoy using it for one-sided sword fights. All in all, this is an excellent addition to any Imaginext collection, or even on its own (despite only coming with a Batman figure), it would be appreciated by any little Batman fan.",

This one has a disc shooter, a crane that flies batman around, a waterfall door, a jail, the bat signal, the bat computer, etc. There's stuff to do in every corner of the set. I also really like the bat motorcycle it comes with. I think the waterfall door is very creative too. When the batcaves first came out, there were few imaginext superhero sets. Now it seems like every other set is somethign superhero. I still think the batcave ones are some of the best!",

This baddie is pretty nice -it comes with a special light brick and has talons and grippers with which to attack the good guys. (More importantly, as a parent, it comes with the batteries needed to use this light brick\u2026 THANK YOU!)

                "review_text": "The biggest struggle that I have with this set is whether Ace the Bat-Hound should have been released in a Lego Juniors set -- one that is targeted for younger builders. Lego seems to have really wanted to release the Ace the Bat-Hound figure and it didn't matter where. I am clearly not giving Ace the Bat-Hound enough credit, but if I'm Batman and I'm rolling on my over-sized three-wheel motorbike against two Talon Assassins, maybe I don't bring the Bats best friend. This set almost panders to collectors. Get the Ace the Bat-Hound figure. Get another new Batman fig. Get pearl gold weapons - two kitanas, two (Wolverine-style) claws, two Bat shields, two Bat-tle axes (like what I did there?) and three Bat-erang type weapons. Plus three pearl gold bat badges for the vehicle. And...uhhhh....get one huge three-wheeled motor bike that is nothing like any Batman vehicle in your collection. The recent trend to show Batman at his most vulnerable continues with this minifig. He looks like the two Talon Assassins are giving him all he can handle and they've managed to break the mask he wears under his cowl. He has a double-sided face and the one I describe isn't shown in the product photos. He has weird shoulder pads, but everyone loves a new Batman figure. I am not familiar with the Talon Assassins, but they apparently represent the Court of Owls and have been part of Batman for over 50 years, so they are fun to add to the collection. Though, I still believe that their weapons will be more prized than the figures themselves. The bike is too big. Mom or Dad will buy this set because they want the new figures and weapons and they will build the bike for a child to try to make up for stealing the figures and weapons. I'm not saying that is what I did personally. Just a guy I know... I love the Ace the Bat-Hound figure. He is placed prominently among my Batmen.",

The Batman minifigure in this set is equipped with Heavy Armor, and this is the first time this version has appeared in any set. He comes with a plethora of Bat-themed weapons, including Batarangs, shields, etc. The other two minifigures are \"Talons\", members of The Court of Owls. This is their first appearance in a LEGO Batman set which is quite exciting. They are equipped with gold katanas and Wolverine claws. Another figure (not considered a minfigure) is included in the set, which is Ace The Bat-Hound, who hasn't appeared in a set before, so his inclusion is most welcome here. He comes with a cape. The main build of this set is a three-wheeled vehicle for Batman to drive, which doesn't have much to it in terms of play functions, although there are stud shooters and storage for weapons on the side. There is a sticker on the front of the vehicle. I like this set, although the vehicle build is quite odd and I don't feel like it's something Batman would use. What really makes this one shine though are the figures, all four of which are exclusive to this set. Definitely recommended to any LEGO Batman fan or minifig collector!",

If you don't get it perfectly aligned on its LEGO Technic axle, it scrapes against the arch that goes over the wheel, and it won't turn right. So you end up having to practically drag the vehicle across the floor. 2. It's not very sturdy. I was tiptoeing across the floor, and I accidentally bumped the car.

                "review_text": "Build: Comes with a Batman minifig which is slightly different from the original Lego movie minifig. Extremely detailed and sturdy overall. Small pieces and wheels tend to fall off but easy to replace. The wires are integrated well and it's easy to access the Bluetooth and battery compartment. It takes 6 AAA batteries which is ridiculous. The stud shooters are manual so they're fairly useless because you have to go over to the batmobile to launch the studs. There's not much to play with when you're not using the app. The car can't roll without the motors, so if you're not controlling it with the app/batteries, it just sits there. I guess you could shoot the studs. App: The app is free and has two sets of controls. It takes a long time to pair your device sometimes and tends to quit unexpectedly. This new feature of Lego is definitely its own league. It's super cool and awesome and the recordings of Batman talking are really fun. The car is extremely maneuverable and speedy.",

                "review_text": "I had high expectations for this set, and this set topped them. The build itself is pretty straightforward, but the car performs exceptionally well. It is agile, responsive, and has two variable speed motors that go forwards and backwards. It needs 6 AAA batteries that all go in the receiver, which then sends power to the motors. The variable speed and separate controls for each motor allow you to move slowly, fast, turn backwards or forwards, go in a large or small circle, or even spin in place! The car is controlled using the LEGO Powered Up app running on a smartphone or tablet.It controls the car via bluetooth and works quite well. The app has 2 drive modes; one is smoother and you have more control, the other is easier to use. You might want to ensure your device can run that app to avoid disappointment, as no other remote is included with this set. The app also works with a couple of train sets, 60197 Passenger Train and 60198 Cargo Train, but those also include a remote. We don't have one so don't know if it would work with this car. The app is better though because it has a lot of buttons for preset patterns, such as back up and turn around, or zig zag, etc. These are quick movements that could be challenging to replicate manually. The motors and bluetooth receiver could easily be used in a custom build for all sort of things. For example, it would work to sync two smartphones to their own custom cars and have a demolition derby. The included Batman minifigure is very detailed and so far is exclusive to this set. He easily fits into the spacious and fancy driver's cabin. The car is fairly low to the ground so struggles in grass, and quickly picks up stuff on the axles on my carpet - but being LEGO it is super easy to take apart and clean. There were some extra bat shaped pieces included different from any in the build. This is a really cool and unique set that opens up whole new possibilities for custom LEGO projects! Great for kids and adults. Highly recommended!",

                "review_text": "The new Lego City Trains and this Batmobile have begun using an iOS and Android app called Powered Up. If you are used to the boxes that have batteries inside motorized vehicles, they look or are the same. The difference here is that the remotes are now gone in favor of this new app used on your device. No more batteries for your Lego remotes and no more Lego remotes on different frequencies and you aren't sure which one controls which train, etc. The Build: Very straight-forward as it only has 321 pieces. Took about 40 minutes. The Batman figure here is very detailed and interesting and is clearly a jewel of this set. Because it's a remote controlled vehicle that could be bumping in to things, the item is very solidly built and does not break easily. Using it as a remote controlled vehicle: It connects via Bluetooth. Press and hold the button at the top and Voila it connects. The menu has two options at the moment which are Lego City and Batman. After that, you can see the picture of the control portion of the app I took. Each slider moves the right or left wheel and that's how you turn it. You can do wheelies, go fast or slow, or backward. The range is about the typical for Bluetooth maybe 60-70 feet. The engine has good torque and can go up hills and drive over small items. My son has had a lot of fun playing with this item, more than a normal Lego set. Given the remote function, I think it could be a staple for awhile. I wish it were priced at $90. Because it's Lego of course you can customize it or add your own figs to it. Lego did a nice job with this one.",

Lastly, for our account purposes we need the itemized invoice for what is being paid for in the current invoice.

So in other words, the amount that is due should also have the itemized invoice in the following pages in addition to the other active charges. I can't pay for an item if I can't code it in our budget and I shouldn't have to flip between different invoices from different months to figure it out. Keep it simple.

We don't want her to get used to sleeping in a bed with us, so we were looking for options for her to sleep while we are away from home. I stumbled on this cot and read all the reviews. Some reviewers said the cot tips over if the kid sits on one end; I did not experience this. My kid is about 33 lbs and did not tip the cot over when she was sitting on one end of it. Another reviewer said the cot folded in on the kid and had no locking mechanism. While I agree that there is no locking mechanism, I had no problem with the cot folding in on itself at any point. The cot isn't far from the ground, so I wasn't really worried about her falling off. We did notice that she moved off of it to sleep on the floor the first few nights, but we remedied that once we took away a few stuffed animals and gave her more room on the cot. I did not feel like my child was unsafe at any time. My 2 yr old is about 37 inches tall, and she fits fine on this cot. We only ran into space issues because she likes to have too many stuffed animals on the bed! I expect to be able to use this cot until she's at least 4. Oh and side note, my child still sleeps in a crib at home, and she had no issues adjusting to sleeping on this cot or going back to sleeping in a crib after we returned home. It folds up to the size of a child's camping chair and has a carrying case. It is very light, and we plan on taking this with us on a 3 week trip. We';; either take it as one of our carry-ons or stick it in a checked bag. Oh and there is no \"set up\" involved. You just pull it out of the bag and open it up like you would a camping chair. This is a great product. I would give this cot 5 stars if the sheet that had come with it actually fit on the cot. It was too small and caused the cot to fold up a lot when I put the sheet on. I just use a crib sheet instead (which I have plenty). The crib sheet is too big but not to where it is a problem or comes off the cot. I attached pictures for reference.",

They always ended up falling apart (I guess that's to be expected at such a cheap price). For Christmas this year, I decided to find a better quality set and I ended up purchasing two of the Crayola Premier Sets. First things first, what you get is what is pictured - the Inspiration Art Set, not the Premiere Set, which has scissors. The case is sturdy and it's packed with the items your child will actually use, NOT things like the useless pastel chalk/crayons or cheap water color paint set like some other sets have. This set has crayons, small colored pencils, pipsqueak markers, regular markers, and sheets of drawing paper. And, of course, it's the Crayola brand quality you know and trust. One thing should be noted...Christmas was less than a week ago and one of the clasps on my 11 year old's Crayola case has already broken and fallen off. I contacted Crayola through their Facebook page and asked how to get a replacement, and they promptly replied requesting the model number and my mailing address. I'm assuming they are sending a replacement, and I will update when I know for sure. This set is nice and will certainly be perfect for any child who likes to draw or color. It may be better suited for a child who is able to take reasonably good care of it. My 10 and 11 year olds seem to enjoy their cases more than anything else they've received for Christmas this year, and that's saying a lot! Edited to add: Crayola contacted me and they are indeed shipping me a new Inspiration Art Set to replace one daughter's breaking case. They gave me the choice between a new set or same-value coupons for other Crayola products, and I chose to receive a new set since both daughters enjoy this set so much. What fantastic customer service!",

The bounty of the kit is traditional crayons, coming in at 64 different colors (if my basic math skills don't fail me); but, on top of crayons, there are 20 half-size colored pencils, 20 half-size color markers, and 20 full-size color markers. It even includes a pack of paper - albeit it looks like an instruction manual package with blank instructions and unbound (i.e., finding it was more of an oddity than a necessity; it made me laugh seeing it). The markers are water soluble - I had no trouble wiping away marks that missed the paper. There is no pencil sharpener, but I'd honestly rather my daughter not be playing around with a small razor - so you'll probably need to get one to keep separate. And yes it comes with paper, but if you have no decent art paper or coloring books, you'll likely want to grab that too - in the spirit of the kit, I'd say art paper over coloring books. And a clip board or a 2x4 hardboard with large clips on it can keep the attention and the color on the paper. Overall, for what it comes with and its great price, I would recommend giving it a go. It certainly is aimed at an age group, so if your child is starting to really round out their art and are interested in going further, this won't satisfy. This is a kit for a child to develop an initial expression of interest in art (just beyond the wild scribbling phase).",

I suspect that the majority of the low reviews for this microscope are from people that either have little microscope experience or were expecting it to do things it was never designed to do. I have a degree in biology (although I'm not employed in a biological field), so I have plenty of experience using lab quality microscopes. This microscope produces a reasonable level of clarity and magnification. Children will be able to see individual cells, and even nuclei. Yes, it can be a little bit hard to focus at times since there is no fine adjustment, only coarse, and yes, your field of view does move a bit while adjusting it. But again, this is a $40 microscope made for kids. This is more than good enough to introduce your child (or even adults) to the world of microscopy. The kit is great, and will give the user plenty of things to do with the microscope. A few prepared slides, and tools to make some simple slides of your own are included, along with the brine shrimp kit. I was pleasantly surprised by what this microscope can do, and can't wait to give it to my daughter for the holidays (I took it out of the box and tested it first due to some of the bad reviews on here). If you are inexperienced with microscopes, here are a few tips: make sure that what you are trying to view is in the center of the aperture (where the light comes through), and always start on the lowest magnification.",

This is an amazing microscope for the price and works really well. I have a history of working with them and found it very easy to find the samples on the slides. They also showed up really nicely. The key it to start with the smallest magnification (300), once you have found your sample and focused on it then attempt using the higher magnifications. Some of the slides are not meant to be seen with the highest magnification. Also be sure to clean all slides before viewing as all of ours had dust on them. It will be harder to see anything with dust on the slide. The eye piece also needed to be cleaned because it was dusty. The microscope is metal, the stage is plastic with plastic clips. I did find it a bit annoying that I could not move the stage from side to side, so when viewing I had to move the slide its self. I have not used the hatchery or any of the other things as I am gifting this in a month. Even without using those items I am very pleased with this product. It was better then I could have imagined. I cant wait to make slides with my daughter and see what we can see. I have included some images I captured of each slide with my camera. These are not as clear as they are when viewing it through the scope with your eyes. However I wanted to show everyone that this microscope does indeed work. I found all of the samples with in a matter of minutes besides the corn root (blue slide with small round circles on it all in rows). The corn root is pale yellow, making it hard to see with the light shining on it. So I used the blue light filter to help bring it out better. I hope this helps you all feel more comfortable about making your decision with this brand. The carrying case is a nice plus too.",

We used the little mist bottle that it came with to mist the seeds and in about 24 hours the seeds were already sprouting! Just awesome to watch!

When they start growing on the edge of the container and outside (and they will) they will drip on the surface. I had a paper towel under mine and it went through the paper towel on the window sill and is impossible to remove without repainting! 2. If they get dusty do not put under water!

                "review_text": "This set is AWESOME! I highly recommend it! I purchased it to grow crystals in the office as a fun experiment to keep me entertained during busy season and it did not disappoint. You need to be sure to follow the instructions carefully. I made a fatal error on my first attempt and did not wait the full 30 minutes before I added the crystal seeding and nothing ended up growing. On the subsequent attempts I followed the instructions to a T and was able to grow beautiful crystals. I even ordered a second set because the results were astounding. The steps are simple enough I was able to grow these in my office with ease. All you need is boiling water and the rest is provided in the kit. The first step is to dissolve the crystal mixture (it looks almost like sugar) into hot water. Next, you have to let it sit for 15 minutes, and then transfer it into a clear plastic container where the crystal will grow. WAIT ANOTHER 30 MINUTES after the water is transferred. This step is crucial otherwise the crystals will not grow. Once you have waited the allotted time you drop in the crystal seeds. They provide blue, red, and white crystals so you can mix and match them to create different colored crystals. It seems that each type of crystal seed grows a different shape of crystal. I noticed that the red crystal seeds will grow more block-like crystals whereas the blue seeds will create more sharp/pointy crystals that flower out. Blue and red will create a crystal that looks like a combination between the two - it flowers out but is more block-like. Keep this in mind when you choose the colors you make. You will start seeing growth overnight. Its amazing to watch the progress. On the instructions it says it takes 4-7 days before the crystals are fully grown. I would keep an eye on them and drain the water when the crystal is about to emerge from the water. If you leave it too long the crystal is exposed to the air it will form \"snow-like\" growths on the top (which I think are ugly). The rate of growth will be affected by the temperature of the room as well as the size of the crystal you are growing. The crystals grow well in warmer temperatures. The small crystals will finish growing faster than the large ones. Each bag of crystal mixture can either make 1 large one, 2 medium sized one, or 4 small ones. The kit allows you to grow 1 large crystal, 2 medium crystals, and 4 small crystals simultaneously because that is the amount of containers they provide. If you want to grow 3 large ones you can grow them one at a time because they only provide one large container. I think the large crystals are the coolest.All in all this is an amazing kit. Everyone in the office is jealous and now they want to grow their own crystals too. 5 stars!!! I want to make ALL the crystals!",

                "review_text": "I bought this set of crystals because it was the same brand as a previous crystal kit I had bought with tickets at an arcade. The first kit was awesome so I decided to give this a try. This kit says you can make 7 individual crystals. You can't make 7 big crystals, but you can make 1 big, 2 medium, and 4 small (OR you could make 3 big only. It is based on how much crystal seeding and powder they start you with) It says the colors are assorted but I'm willing to bet that every kit comes with 1 pack of white, 1 pack of blue, and 1 pack of red. The kit encourages you to mix red and blue to make purple and mix the blue or red with white to make pink or light blue. The image I have attached is what color you get when you mix red and white. I think the reason some folks have trouble making these crystals grow is because they aren't following the directions exactly. I use filtered tap water that I measure and pour out of my brita. I heat the water on my stove in a pot. I stir in the bag of powder until it is all dissolved. I wait until it cools to add the seeding mixture (this set has you transfer the crystals from an opaque cup to a clear display cup for growing so you can make multiple at a time. I recommend this because the display cups are easier to see through, however, when you transfer the liquid you MUST wait 30 minutes for the contents to settle before you add the seeding crystals) Then once you sprinkle them on, don't stir or bump the container. You gotta let it sit for about a week before your crystals are fully developed. I usually wait until the tip of the highest crystal is about to peek out of the surface of the water. I display my crystals on my windowsill in my kitchen instead of in the plastic display containers. I don't have kids though, so I'm not worried about them breaking or anything. Anyway, I love watching these crystals grow. They're hard enough to handle gently and observe, but some of the smaller crystals are fragile and can snap off. I wanted something that would make crystals for displaying and that is what I got! For $14 this was an awesome deal for me. The instructions were clear and concise and I'd totally buy it again (but then I'd have so many crystals my husband would start to worry!)",

I've been a little less than a 1/4 mile away with no drop in signal or voice (other than when my daughter forgets to push the button to talk). The handsets have a few buttons to adjust sound or change frequency and some menu items, but for straight walkie-talkie'ing, just power on and press the talk button. (and let go to listen to the other person). The one thing I don't like is there is a little 'chirp' sound like the old Motorola/Nextel 'push-to-talk' features. My daughter likes it, but she is 4 and has no concept of stealth. She uses it when she is two feet away (I CAN HEAR YOU WITHOUT THE WALKIE-TALKIE, SWEETY!!) Anyway - these are a lot of fun and seem very professional with sound clarity and distance for the price. Easy enough for a 4 year old to use too (OVER)",

But when you hold it in your hand it doesn\u2019t feel like a toy. They are well made and feel solid and durable. The buttons work well, voices are clear, and the range is at least half a mile and probably more under good conditions. So why do I give them only four stars? The reason is the miserable instructions. I think the included leaflet of instructions for the user was written to cover many models by the same manufacturer, because some of the instructions are wrong and some don\u2019t make sense. The units have some features that I can\u2019t use because I don\u2019t know how. For example, the squelch is probably adjustable but I don\u2019t know how to do that. The result is to make me feel stupid. Let me end this review before I decide to take two stars off.",

I think these are bound to amuse and entertain kids of almost any age, and most adults too. The charging base takes three AA batteries. The quality of these is fantastic, and I believe they will last for a long time without breaking. They are small, and can easily fit in your pocket. Besides using them for playtime, I could see the benefit of these for actual walkie talkie use as well, say for a camping trip, or to keep in touch at a theme park. I read other reviews claiming the range of these walkie talkies is about a mile and a half to two miles, and I think that's accurate. We didn't take them quite that far yet, but we had no problems with crackling or speaking with clarity. Makes a great gift!",

I'm not a fuddy-duddy when it comes to things that make noise, and my kids love all things music, so I thought this mat would be a hit. However, even my twin two year olds say it can get too loud right after they turn it on. The volume control works well, and has to be the very first thing adjusted when it is turned on, the kicker is when the sound box goes into sleep mode if left on and unattended for only about 15 mins, the volume defaults to the loudest setting when woken up again. This can be a little startling when they step on it again. Other than the wonky sound settings, this is sturdy, plays well and is a lot of fun!

Usually ones that are harder to crack are mostly rock and less cavelike crystal space. Only one of the rocks in this lot was hard to break, and that was because it was completely solid crystal. I'm not too upset about it because that's just the nature of geodes- sometimes you get a rock. 9/10 geodes is good enough for me. Now, a problem is that even though there were many decent sized geodes, there were two that were pretty small. One was extremely small and seemed to have been under 1.5 inches in diameter. Another thing is that about 6 of them were the same type of rock and looked exactly the same inside. I wasn't expecting a hand-picked assortment, but when over half of them are the same rock despite the varieties that exist, it seems a bit odd. Maybe I just got a bad lot. But even still, the quality and overall easy-opening of these geodes compared to the other brands I've bought will keep me coming back for more every time I decide to start a new craft project.",

Only one of the rocks was somewhat solid, but it still was filled with crystals. There were two different types of geodes in the kit. All of the crystals were either white or light gray-purple-ish.

Because they are real, no one can look inside ahead of time and make sure all ten geodes will be spectacular when opened. I didn't get any with beautiful colored crystals inside, but most were hollow with interesting crystals. Only one was not quite hollow, but it had a swirl of pale blue agate inside of it, so we were pleased. My thirteen year old son and I used a regular old claw hammer and had no trouble opening any of them, although read the instructions carefully!! Some of them are actually pretty fragile and will dissolve into a pile of sand if you whack too hard to start. We also used a chisel with some of them to try to achieve an even split, as the instructions suggested. We did this outside on the pavement as it does make a small mess (easily swept away). I am only giving four stars instead of five because unless you have a portable vice (or are willing to pound geodes in your workshop), one person does have to hold the geode (and chisel) in place while the other person swings the hammer. It's inherently hazardous. I was the \"holder\" while my son wielded the hammer. Luckily, I still have all my fingers and some nice geodes to boot.",

Not very fun to finally break open the largest geodes in the box only to find they have no crystals and are no better than your average rock. Felt a little jilted about that but she was still excited about the smaller geodes which the kids were able to break open fairly easily. Would have been nice to have gotten more variety on the crystal colors. My experience with kits like this is that most of the geodes have white crystals. This one had all white with 2 bluish.

It's hard to explain to a child but I think I did my best I told her that a lot of people have to really really like it and then they will make more. She told me that we need to tell you how much we like the show so you will make more. Please make more so we don't have to watch the applesauce episode multiple times a day. This is such a cute concept for a show because it goes hand-in-hand with the books. I love the other characters in the show especially the pig and little girl because we also have the book if you give a pig a pancake. Kids can really identify with the shout if they have read the book. We have watched other Amazon pilot shows for kids and have liked several of them but not as much as this one. I think the animation is wonderful and reminds us of the animation in her book. Please please please pick up this show and give us more! Thanks!",

I'd say that's a sucessful gift. I also asked a week later if they were still working on the same batteries and was told yes. There were quite a few settings on the gloves to chose from (every time u pressed the button again) like solid glow, strobbing, chosing only the tips to glow, or a certain color (as there are 3 colors per pair) or you could make them gradually fade into the next color. Now my sister wants 2 sets of her own to DJ with, lol. Fir adults, I think these might be cool for artistic spectacle or even for clubbers. For children, I like that the kids can go play in the yard at night and you can still keep an eye on them per their glowing hands.",

This company means to have 100% satisfied customers. For that we give a 5 star rating. Below is our earlier review. Bought 3 pair of these according to the advertisers age/size recommendations. Kids size fit out 5 yr old good; he wears clothing 5/6. Kids size way way too small for our 8 year old; she wears clothing size 10. Teen size fit our 11 year old good he wears size 12 clothing. Also the red light in the right fourth fingertip of the teen gloves doesn't light up. The gloves are nicely made and fun for a while, for kids they fit, but 8 year old was dissapointed. Would not buy these again as not worth $15 / pair. Don't want the hassle of returning small size and one w/o red light back.

I prefer a chair without arms so I can scoot up to the desk, and the mesh back is much more breathable. I use this AmazonBasics chair for programming and development. It's not the kind of chair you want if you like to lean back and consume media on your computer, but for computer tasks it is great.

My older child used his for the trip but hasn't used it much since. My daughter keeps her permanently installed and uses it every time we are in the car. I would rate this product three stars except for the fact that it is the only thing I found like it so there aren't really a lot of other options. It does have some pretty major flaws though. First of all, it is not wipable and the fabric is not water proof so any spill soaks through to whatever board it is lined with--probably a heavy cardboard. It is the nature of kids to spill anything that is remotely spillable so her tray is predictably gross and stained and there's not a thing I can do about it. See photo. That's just a basic ice cream spill (and probably a drink or two. Who knows. LOL). The other most annoying design issue is that it's pretty hard to zip closed because the zipper pull is short and gets stuck way back in a crease. So it's not an easy thing to close it away when you want to get out of the car. We have basically given up on closing it so it's just always in the way. But on the plus side, she does use it a lot and it helps her do the many things she wants to do while we are driving. With as much time as we spend in the car, this is helpful. Not sure how much longer it will hold up. For the price I'm hoping for at least a year of use.",

We had high hopes for a big road trip, went to attach the organizer, cinched the straps as tight as they can go and the when the table is folded down, it's a solid 6\" below the kids knees. We have 1 in a booster and one in a car seat, both are positioned way to high for this product to be functional. The table is at an extreme \"downward\" angle, impossible to be used. Unfortunately, we purchased these 2 months prior to our April road trip and the \"return window\" has expired, we are stuck with some expensive and poorly designed organizers and can't imagine any vehicle these could work on. A better design would be a MUCH smaller version, these are huge.",

                "review_text": "This review comes after a coast to coast drive across the US. This product has great potential, however it is lacking in a few areas, which really brings down the rating for me. The backseat organizer was useful and provided a space for the kids to play, eat, and do homework assignments. It kept everything, for the most part, fairly organized, which was nice. Like others have stated, the zipper really is cheap. It is very difficult to zip up and constantly gets hung up in both directions. The kids were very frustrated by this. The tab on the zipper also broke within 30 days of use. The handle used to attach the organizer to the backseat could use a little more reinforcement, or an entirely different design. In order to make sure it was at the correct height for my children I had to cinch it down quite a bit, which really pulled on the material, and ultimately the strap tore away from the organizer. I think this probably would have happened over time anyway, just because of the stress on the strap when attached to the seat. It pulls regardless of the amount of pressure. In order to use it again, I will have to sew the strap and find a way to reinforce it so it doesn't come apart again. After all, did it serve it's purpose? Yes. However, I would've liked to see this as more of a long term accessory to our road trip adventures. Overall, I love the idea, I like the product, I just wish it was a little more durable.",

I\u2019d tried the lap desks before but they were such a pain to dig my child out from under, at each rest stop. This was much easier. My once concern is that the straps may tear off after a while.

This is a cool because it: 1) enables you to skip the purchase of tons of karoyke CDs, especially those your kids will demand today, but never listen to again by next month 2) plug in your Ipad and use the zillions of karaoke song/video lyrics that can be found on YouTube 3) plug in your Mp3 or iphone--especially if you have a streaming service --and find virtually any karaoke recording you could ever want and blast it through the singing machine. My next project is to use the chromecaster so that the YouTube karaoke lyrics can be broadcast on the TV, because now the lyrics only scroll on the ipad, not the TV. this is a small tradeoff though because YouTube is providing a vast karaoke library without purchasing lots of CDs, some of which will fall out of favor with the group. It's best to turn the ipad volume all the way up in order to get maximum sound. One other thing, especially for little kids, that makes this cable a good idea----the songs that little kids often want to sing from their favorite recording artists are difficult--it's not the worst thing in the world to sing along WITH their favorite recordings--the mike easily enables the child's voice to boom over the singer's voice...but the singer is there for a guide; it's hard for little kids and even some adults to follow scrolling lyrics. OK so this may not be pure karaoke, but I bought this to entertain the kids, so I'm not a stickler for karaoke rules :-) If you get this stereo cable, you are REALLY upgrading a relatively inexpensive karaoke model !",

It's great that Garmin has put out a JR version of their tracker, and it's more than just smaller. Garmin vivofit JR provides a lot of features which are easily accessed through a single function button. Perhaps MOST importantly it actually tells the time. There are so many fitness trackers out there which don't seem to care about the time! It also has: a stop watch, a chore tracker, task timers (like for brushing your teeth), minutes active tracking, step tracking, and a coin system for doing chores. All this is linked to a parent controlled app which was very easy to set up and get working. The band is well sized for our 9 year old and the tracker is water proof. It's great to see a company tailor their product for kids and not just re-size it, but customize the whole experience (including being able to have your kids name on the time!). My daughter loves it, and it motivates her to keep moving.",

                "review_text": "I bought this for my 8 year old's birthday two weeks ago. The Garmin Vivofit Jr. is more amazing then I expected! The day after her birthday, I was ordering a Vivofit Jr. for my 5 and 10 year old children. Each child is really into all the functions, steps taken, daily activity time, chores complete, coins received, the timers and stop watch. Before bed, my children like to read the trail, the next clue or animal. We have sat down as a family to design rewards. On Fridays, if they have earned enough coins, they can receive their allowance or bank coins for other rewards. My five year old is learning higher numbers and reading time. My 8 and 10 year old have asked to use the treadmilll (rainy days) or go for bike rides to meet daily goals. They are really excited when they have doubled, even tripled, their daily activity goals. Their chores are done quicker (and correct), they are asking for more ways to help around the house. As a teacher, best educational practice is to have students set their own goals and identify their consequences (positive and negative). The Vivofit Jr. allows us to do this with easy management and quick feedback. I wish there was an immediate, affordable system for tracking positive behavior like this which I could use in school with my students. When my mom friends and teacher friends have seen the watches and the app, they have purchased Vivofit Jrs. for their children. My children's friends are asking their parents for ones. It is great the Vivofit Jr. fits bands for the Vivofit 3. As they get older it will not look childish with a replacement band. I write very few reviews. This is such a cool product with useful, practical functions, I needed to write a review.",

When a friend told me her kids still loved their watches after 2 months, I went ahead and got them for my own kiddos. It's been wonderful. My kids now compete to earn points by doing chores etc. They beg for more chores or tasks to do when they are close to hitting a point goal. I love that it's controlled by an app on my phone, and that I can edit the rewards and chores. My kids love the timers for brushing teeth and cleaning, the piggy bank on the watch that tells you how many coins you have earned, and competing with each other to climb the trail if they hit 60 minutes of activity each day. I love that you don't have to charge this watch, and that it's completely water proof. It survived beach trips and a summer in the pool. We have had ours about 6 months and have had no issues. This watch does have it all. It's a must for parents with little ones. I even have parents of my school students get them and we work together to reward effort in class. I can't say enough positive things about this watch.",

You could call this venting out , not arguing but I do want people to think twice before they put in their hard earned money ..On this expensive product. ..$79 !!! Yes I consider it expensive. But I was impressed with its offering and ordered it in May '17 as a gift for my 9yr old daughter. We were delighted with the product though I was lightly disappointed by the screen size .It fit her wrist and she was happy. It was easy to pair and set the chores. The software was novel though there is lot of room for improvement . 2 months, though we didn't explore all the features it was going well. 3rd month, we saw a big blob on the screen and I was mad. I was kicking myself that I should have read more reviews to see if it's common and knew it was beyond the period for return or refund . 4th...The last straw...The strap broke ..My kid was so heartbroken and I'm terribly disappointed. C'mon Garmin ...Seriously !!! U make a product for kids and that too for $79 and what were u thinking....The first thing should be it's durability with their band...Why aren't they even giving a yr warranty for it...And then come.external screen which I think again has to endure the wear and tear....Can't imagine it on boys , especially very active boys. Yes, I know they have screen guard and I made a mistake of not spending another $8 to do that.... And what's with that big black blob on the screen.....In just few mths ??

Fast forward-I unwrapped one for her bath and the color was so vibrant!!!, the toy was so cute, it was a good size toy she will actually play with too and the smell was so wonderful. We just bought our first home ever in 16 years and we have a really big bathroom I still smell the wonderful smells, way better than any candles I\u2019ve ever purchased!, these bathbombs are by far the best bath bombs I have ever bought in my entire life!, I am so impressed.

Make sure you rinse the tub after or you may have a ring on the especially bright ones. CAUTIONARY: These arrived sorta messy. The balls were not wrapped really well so there was \"bath dust\" on the package. DON'T order these with anything edible or something that can't be cleaned off, because my guess is that's common.

This is really unsafe for anyone with little ones running around. Wonderful concept but really needs rivets or another better way of keeping the tiles together.",

The designs are bright and even cuter than the pictures-I really love the race car print. You can't go wrong with Carter's or any Carter's related brand...this is my third boy and I've had ALL KINDS of clothes on them...from super expensive name brands (bought by family members and friends and coincidentally they all rip quickly, don't fit properly, are uncomfortable or are just plain ugly) to \"less expensive\" clothes from Old Navy, Osh-Kosh, Carters, Garanimals, Just One You, Simple Joys and Jumping Beans......Carters (and JOY/SJ), Garanimals and Jumping Beans are (in my opinion) hands down the best fitting, most comfortable and most well made.",

                "review_text": "Earlier this year, I created a \"Summer Bucket List\" for fun activities to complete with my two daughters, and rock painting was on that list. I figured I'd just grab some rocks from outside and use paint we already had, but when I saw this Creativity for Kids Rock Painting Kit, I knew it would be perfect for this Bucket List item. Since children are impatient, it's a good thing the paint can dry fairly well within a few minutes--but only if it's not too thick. Unlike just grabbing supplies you already own, this kit comes with picture transfers, like temporary tattoos, which can go over paint and/or be painted on. Unfortunately, you have to be very careful with the application or there can be smearing, or even no application at all. The rocks included are nice and smooth, but one did come chipped in a couple of spots, and apparently the paint can be damaged if the rocks bump against each other, so you have to be careful transporting them if you want to hide them in your garden or yard, or give to friends or family for gifts. The two brushes allow for different brush strokes, but some of the colors could be darker, or at least use a second or third layer of paint, but I feared messing up the designs. The paint containers open easily, but you have to push hard to snap them close and not all the colors you see on the box are available (such as black for the ladybug). And no, these are not washable paints unfortunately. On the box it also looks like the transfers have dotted lines around them to guide cutting, but they don't. Plus, the gold diamond transfer was damaged when placed face down to view the artwork on the other side of the rock. Despite shortcomings with the transfers, I will say that both my girls and I had fun coming up with designs to decorate the rocks, and we have another successful Bucket List item completed. Overall, this was still easier than gathering up all the materials on our own, so if rock painting sounds like a fun activity, this is a good kit to use.",

                "review_text": "Somehow I thought this was some tiny, foldable little kids' thing. Holy schmoly, this is huge and great for the whole family (if you have the room). It took 3 of us 2 hours to put together. I put it together wrong and had to undo much of it to get it to go together again. I did not enjoy the installation process. But once it was together and we pumped up the 7 balls (they included a ball inflator - thank you!!), and we actually started playing, all annoyance was forgotten! Everyone in the family from ages 5-70, had a blast shooting competitive hoops together. I found myself huffing and puffing after 5-6 games because I was racing so fast to beat my husband and get the high score. Great gentle ab and arm workout. The noises it makes are just some fun beeping and bell sounds to let you know when to start and when the game is called. We get some minor cheering and a ref whistle at the end. The downside is it's huge. The gentleman in the photo is 6'3\". I do not know where to store it, but for winter, it's worth taking up part of the living room. The kids set their bean bag under it and enjoy their ready made fort, and we all have a winter game to play to get some wiggles out. If you have a game room or space in the garage, the family will be stoked about this purchase. We are having SO MUCH FUN!!",

What a great idea to get everyone away from the television and the phones for a while. The entire family loves time playing this arcade game and to the adults, it feels like old home week. With the 8 different games, LED scoring and the game sounds you feel like you are back in a real arcade. The two hoops are great since that means two kids can shoot at the same time and there is no yelling about whose turn it is!!! The cloth balls are sturdy and this entire unit is well made. You can collapse it to move it around but I found that I set it up and just left it in the basement for the kids to play with. It is not that heavy so you really could move it from room to room by folding or just moving it. The kids acted like it was Christmas Day with this thing and it has provided hours of enjoyment for them.",

Set up is easy, and it should fit fine in a game room or rec room - although it is too big for say a child's bedroom. Once set up, you can play a variety of quick shoot basketball games. This is familiar to anyone who has played this at an arcade or bar - you have a limited time to make as many shots as possible. You can play solo or for more fun compete with a friend, both shooting at the same time. There several games programmed in and you shouldn't get bored. Note that this doesn't have the moving rims that some of the bigger arcade games do but that wasn't a big deal to me. This will definitely be used and will liven up any party.",

We were offered a sample of this product in exchange for this unbiased review. It's FUN! It folds up a little to take up a little less space - we've got it in the garage - but you COULD put it in your game room instead of an air hockey game or a billiard table. It comes with 7 little basketballs and a little air pump - it's noticeably less sturdy than the arcade-quality game, but our garage isn't an arcade.

I like that I can pack it quickly in the bag. It has come in handy a few times (easier to carry the bag on my wrist than to carry a coat around) and will be great for travel.
