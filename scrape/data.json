After you built enough Castles, Pirate ships and Fortresses, the models either get put away or they collect dust. I bought a used Mindstorms RCX kit used, 8 or 9 years ago and it was too much of a hassle with the IR tower and a working computer with Windows XP. My older son really was not interested in it after working with the NXT at School as part of a Robotics team. He was one of the main people on the team that understood how to make it work at crunch time in the competition, but Robotics was too nerdy for him. This Christmas I picked up the EV3 for my younger son. He was on the Vex team as a 6th grade student last year. I was hoping to do more on our own since the VEX team is not together this year. As aside note, I participated as a parent in the FLL with when my older son was in middle school and we made the trip with his team to compete at LegoLand. Last year I went to a Vex Tournament and I thought FLL was better at the middle school age group. The format was better and the kids really took pride being able to compete at LegoLand. Back to now - My son quickly built a couple robots that are on shown on the box and the kit got shelved till last week; we have many competing activities so finding projects that would capture his interest was the goal. We found the Mindcub3r Rubik's Cube Solver Robot. This one project really was fun and got my son really interested in the kit again. For us, the project was a medium difficulty level build. It used only pieces from the 31313 kit. Everyone who has seen this Robot is amazed and he was asked to bring it to school. Go to home depot and buy a large parts bin organizer or maybe even the DeWalt DWST14825 here on Amazon might work. It is easier to keep all the lego parts sorted and together. Before you buy any parts bin organizer you just have to make sure there a compartment that will fit the EV3 computer. You really need to go online and look for other projects and information as what comes in the box is good, but limited. We purchased \"The LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Discovery Book\" and my son is already excited to take apart the Rubik's Cube Robot we built and start working on the workbook. Both the Rubik's Cube Bot and the projects in the workbook only need the 31313 kit. $350 might seem like a good chunk of change to put down on something like this, they resell well on eBay if it does not catch on with your kids, but I think as a parent you have to get involved too. I recommend getting the workbook with the kit. I have been looking through the woorkbook and it has some good information and good teaching moments. We are starting the workbook projects tomorrow, so I will update this review in the future.",

                "review_text": "I have waited for two years to write this review. There's a good reason for it. I first bought these as a Christmas gift for my son when he was nine/fourth grade. The reason was that we had sent him to a day camp for a week that same year, and this was what they were using. EDIT: I did not know at the time that there was a difference in the \"retail\" vs. \"educational\" kits, and my son was getting frustrated over some of the things that he could not get the mindstorms to do that he could do at camp. If you get/got these after a Lego robotics camp, it's important to keep that in mind. END EDIT. He was initially ecstatic about them. He and my husband built a few things, and although my son is really focused on science and math, trying to build something on his own was intimidating for him. He didn't really want to build anything unless my husband could guide him. That wasn't what we were going for - my husband is a great dad and spends a lot of time with our son, but our goal was for my son to use his imagination and start creating things himself. We installed the software on my laptop, but as I was working from home at the time, that situation led to issues with trying to get things to work. I found myself really resenting that I shelled out SO much money for toys that were just sitting there. We would find ourselves saying, \"Why don't you go do something with your mindstorms?\" and he'd look at us like he was being punished. Over the course of the next year, he would build a few things, but only sporadically. Fast forward to sixth grade/age 11. He's matured a bit (as much as one can expect of an 11-year-old). But I mean he's got more initiative and can create things without feeling the need to have dad with him. He does have a low-end smartphone, and we said he should get the mindstorms app so he doesn't have to rely on my laptop. He's creating all kinds of things, sending them into the living room to show us while he's in his room. I think that even for a kid who was so geared toward things like this at age nine, he needed more time to really get into these. He's never been one to just build a lego set and keep it that way; he always pulls them apart to create things on his own, and those are usually pretty cool. I guess I thought that he would have been the same way with these, but perhaps the mindstorms were a little overwhelming. I'm not really sure, but I think my tip for anyone is that if their kid doesn't fully get into these right away, give it time. My son is actually using these as part of his science fair project this year.",

They provide just enough color to breathe life into the monochrome mech, without spoiling its complex but utilitarian ruggedness. The traditional space logos and 2nd generation helmets with flip-up visors are a welcome bit of nostalgia, and in brand new vibrant green! The pictures of the Exo Suit and turtle on the box look completely light/dark gray, however some of those elements are actually silvered pieces, which enhance the metallic theme. As mentioned in several reviews here, the build is somewhat intricate, making use of mainly small parts. Often in clever and surprising ways. It was not tedious to put together, and didn't take long. But the build is different than your typical set. For example, the largest pieces in the suit are a 2x6 plate, followed by a 2x4 plate -- and only one of each! Even the ball and socket joints use only short segments, with the arms and legs built up from axles and linkages. The finished model has excellent articulation and posability. Particularly the hands and legs. Also, LEGO has consistently provided extras of the smallest, easiest to lose pieces. Which seems to be most of this set! I had around a dozen extra parts, from rounds to flats to wrenches to spikes to a spacesuit tank and visor. Even still, they have a customer service contact and a complete part listing at the end of the manual, just in case. The instruction book and short story are another nice touch, as usual in several languages. The only drawback was the insets naming some sections of the exosuit seemed to be out of order or on the wrong pages. The instructions were clear and fine, just the annotation seemed to be out of place (wrong page refs in the source file?). Very minor distraction. And in no way diminishes from the sheer awesomeness of this LEGO Ideas set. I hope to see many more of this caliber produced over the coming decades. Finally, I appreciated the sales pitch text saying the design was modular, and encouraged tuning it to your mission. This kind of thinking embodies the creative spirit of LEGO, and the sharing and tweaking and expanding the ideas of others. Thanks for making this set available at a reasonable price for the piece count. And special thanks to the designer (Peter Reid) for doing the work and getting this out there. I'll have to check out your LEGO Space book! (Though a note of caution: When I finished building the Exo Suit, Yve jumped into the cockpit to test it out. Pete grabbed the walkie talkie. He's only scowling because he's trying to sweet talk his way out of the dexterous but gentle grip of an expertly wielded Exo Suit claw... She's grinning ear to ear...) Thanks and happy building.",

He is always building robotic dinosaurs and \"mechs\" using similar techniques, so when he saw this Exo Suit he was so excited. It took him about an hour to build, maybe less (hard to tell because he had to keep stopping for silly things like dinner, homework, and drum lessons), and he was easily able to complete it without any help. Even before he had it half built, he was going on and on about how cool it was. The finished model looks great and is easy to pose and balance standing up. It has a lot of interesting uses of different pieces in ways you might not normally build with, so it's fun that way. I can also see how using pieces in new ways can inspire kids to think creatively about their own projects. My son said he loved the way the legs of the Exo Suit were jointed \"like a lizard or dinosaur,\" and he noticed it even looks awesome from the back. The retro look of the astronauts (and one is a girl, yay Lego!) is a nice touch and the turtle/rover is just plain cute. Of course, the beauty of Lego is that you can adjust it to do your own thing. After playing with the finished set for a while, my son said he thought the arms were a bit too long and that the claws were \"too much.\" He then set about rebuilding them to suit his own taste, resulting in a suit with no claws, fewer fingers, and slightly shorter arms -- with a little help from Lego pieces in his own collection. I have no doubt this is a model that will be played with, displayed, and not taken apart to build something else.",

I have attached two pictures to show how the bricks are bagged and the back paper of the exact bricks you will receive. Several windows, doors, baseplates, wheels, ramps, dots, building bricks, smooth finishing pieces - see picture for exact color and number of each piece. The yellow storage brick is also nice if you do not already have a place for your Legos. I am planning on using it as decor for their Lego themed bday party. If you are looking for other Lego storage options, ikea trofast drawer system was an inexpensive way to organize by color. If you are just getting introduced to Legos, do not expect it to be full once the bags are opened and dumped. You will receive 790 pieces and this retails for $60. At the Lego rule of 10 cents per Lego, this seems to be a great deal. This box full of Legos would be hundreds of dollars. Lego has been around for generations so there isn't a question of durability or craftsmanship. If you need an activity for your children, looking to add to an existing set, giving a gift for a Lego lover this set will be a perfect choice. Anyone who gets involved with Legos knows the obsession that follows to have more bricks, so just add on! I also recommend the classic bright set, that was a great purchase to add the \"girl\" colors to my boys collection of stereotypical boy colors. The classic medium set was ok, but I probably wouldn't purchase that again, I would get the bright set or this large box again.",

                "review_text": "The picture is the biggest house I could build exclusively with ALL of the 4x2 bricks included in this set. As you can see, its just enough to be high enough to cover the minifigures head (not included), but there are not enough left to build a roof. Yes, you could finish the house with other pieces, but at this price, I should have enough 4x2's to build a reasonably sized house. 4x2 bricks are the workhorse of creative building with Lego, no matter how much LEGO has attempted to market smaller, more complex and specific creations as the 'new' heart of Lego, and not buildings and houses. Any child who grew up with Lego knows its *ALL* about the 4x2. This is a 790 piece set, with only *67* 4x2 bricks. On average, most colors only have FOUR 4x2 bricks - !? The 4x2 is relatively large and expensive, so Lego sells sets with really high piece count - like this one at 790 - but uses tiny pieces no one cares about to push up the piece count. In this case, only 8% of the pieces are 4x2's. ...and I love Lego's response to people's complaints about 4x2's - 'hey, come to our website and buy by the BRICK' - where 4x2 pieces are $.30/pc! I don't even think LEGO *wants* to sell these building sets anymore (this set was created 'by demand!'), because the vertical sales of endless expensive, complicated *model* sets of licensed characters (like its own, or Batman, Star Wars, etc) are much more lucrative. Most of these sets aren't even buildable by kids until they are competent readers who can follow complex instructions, and once they have built it, the bricks have little or no replayability. Build the model, you're done. Did I mention these model sets seem half the size of as the picture on the box? Some of Lego's model sets are completely phoned in as well - the original Minecraft sets, for example - uh, my kids and I have played ALOT of Minecraft - the original Minecraft sets - I don't even know what they were *supposed* to look like - they looked like a mess - and, of course, where Minecraft is a game of large 1 meter square blocks, the LEGO version was comprised of tons of the tiniest pieces I have ever seen. Once we opened the box, we didn't even bother building our Minecraft set, it was so disappointing. Having bought only one other model sets other than the Minecraft one, I don't even like my kids to see the model sets in the store - because yes, the cover art is exciting and cool, but I know that the out-of-the-box experience is not. Dad will wind up building the entire thing, my daughter will play with it for 5 minutes, start taking some pieces apart, and it will be nothing more than a mess of tiny toy pieces no one plays with for the rest of its lifespan. I have talked to other parents, and Lego's strategy is a universal disappointment. Lego, the 'CLASSIC' Lego experience is having a child open their first set of legos, which is mostly 4x2, so they can build big, beautiful buildings of their own imagination. You can sell your one-off model kits, but let's see you sell at least ONE set which is mostly 4x2, and bring that core experience of replayability back to kids of this generation. I chose this set because it does contain some parts I think are important for a core set - like windows, doors, and wheels - but when I see the vast number of tiny useless filler this set has, it just makes me upset about what kid's experience is with modern Lego marketing.",

I do advise buying a separate Lego organization solution. * The diversity of pieces is a little thoughtless, and there aren't enough basic pieces of any one color. I purchased an extra \"Lego Creative Supplement\" package, and still had trouble getting enough pieces for the wall and roof of the home. The kinds of pieces available to any color is also a little capricious. I wish they removed some of the colors and just gave more basic pieces. * The sole green base plate it comes with is small, and I'm surprised there isn't at least one more base plate. ++ Verdict: I wanted to take out my wallet and convert money into an ideal classic Lego introductory experience, but alas, this large classic box, even with a creative supplement, lacked the right quantity of basic pieces. I ended up going to the Lego website to buy large bundles of basic pieces in just a few basic colors, and the price was surprisingly reasonable.",

Once you open the bags, it would probably take up one fifth of the bin. Do not think this bin is coming filled to the top, that would be hundreds of dollars. The bin itself would be great for storage if you needed. I am planning on saving it for their Lego themed birthday party to set up paper plates or silverware in. This is a classic set nostalgic to the bins I had as a child. I am a fan of Lego in general, I like their kits because they allow my 5 and 3 year old to create trains, cars, etc that look cool and are fun to play with. These classic kits allow for their Imaginationon to run wild as they dig in. This set came with 35 colors. I was happy with the assortment of pieces, some of the smooth finishing pieces, ramps, dot pieces, grated pieces. It had a selection of wheels and hubs, tiny size and medium. Without the tires you can create train wheels. There were several small black windows, without shutters or panes. And one tiny arch window that is pictured on the front. There's also the smooth dot eyeballs. This kit contained a few base plates, the largest was 8x16. Also a brick separator, which is really cool device so you don't have to use your teeth. Right now we are getting these classics sets to bulk up my kids collection for free building. I do like this medium set for the variety it contains. I have read that you shouldn't pay more than ten cents per Lego (accounting for differences in variety of sizes). This kit retails for $30, so with that little thought in mind it is a great price and variety. I also recommend the the $20 Lego classic bright box. It contained great colors, and didn't have wheels or windows- mostly building bricks. if you are just getting started with Legos- buy it. If you need a gift for a Lego lover- buy it. If you want to add on to your/your child's collection- buy it. Getting more Legos can never be wrong, especially when they build your child's imagination and keep them busy for hours!",

After scouring the internet for a weekend I settled on buying a ton of usa made, but CHEAP, not lego \"legos\" that were sold here on amazon and fit just fine with actual legos. I wound up finding 1000 mixed size building blocks for around 20 bucks. Through lego anything even close cost around or over 100 dollars and wouldn't have contained many actual building blocks. Finding anything sold by lego that had a good mix of building blocks and \"flavor\" or \"special\" connecting blocks, like axles and windows/doors, was impossible. It was mostly the special or flavor pieces and only ever a handful of proper building blocks. The only set that contained a majority of building blocks had somewhere around 1500 pieces but it cost over 150 bucks! In the end I bought this set solely as a \"special\" and \"flavor\" lego set. It gives you some axles, a door, and enough oddball and unique pieces that you can actually turn some building blocks into something other than just a tower. You can build a handful of things listed in a pamphlet that comes with it but after that the options are pretty limited without some real building blocks to throw into the mix. To sum up this is a great addition to a collection solely because there are not many other options out there that don't cost an arm and a leg and which also have as many unique pieces. Buy this and a couple of bags of cheap off brands and you've got a good start on a collection. Oh, and don't forget the extra large base boards!",

I built identical buildings with lots of brick brands and this did better than LEGO! It was the only set I tested that came with a guarantee which was impressive as well. The sizes and shapes of bricks reflect wonderfully what kids actually NEED in order to build what they most often build. (LEGO was always very skewed toward small pieces with only 1 or 2 token large bricks per set.) By my calculation, this set had 29% more of the larger pieces than the equivalent LEGO set (discontinued) as well as plenty of the most valuable 2x2 and 2x4 pieces because most projects use this size of brick. This company is the only brand I tested that has a 2x2 plate piece which is something kids have asked me for year after year and LEGO never offered in their basic set. There are lots of large plates which are invaluable for cars, planes, and animals which are the first things most kids try to build. (I really wish there were enough wheels to make 2 or 3 cars because I always have to buy those separately and the color brown for things like trees, hair, and skin, but most beginning builders don't focus on color much so that is a minor detail.) The packaging was nice, with a parts list on the side which I love.",

When I came across these for a fraction of the price I was skeptical, but after reading the positive reviews I gave it a go. I'm not disappointed, neither is he. They fit with the lego brand perfectly, they are great quality aND I will definitely buy more later as needed. Also this is the ONLY company that has ever emailed me just to be sure I'm satisfied.

The 1,100 piece kit from Building Bricks was exactly what we were looking for. The Big Questions: 1. Do they really work well with Lego Brand Legos? Yes - they work very well. It's difficult to tell the difference if you're not really trying hard. 2. How much cheaper are they? Is it really worth it? It's hard to compare exact pricing here because this set does not include wheels, doors or special pieces. If I had to choose a product to compare it to, I'd probably compare it with Lego's XXL Classic Box (https://www.amazon.com/10697-Building-Large-Creator-Pieces/dp/B00XJ5C4FW). When pricing per piece, the Lego box is about 5\u00a2 per piece. And yes, you read that right. You're dolling out a nickel for every piece of plastic with Lego's brand stamped on it. :) Building Bricks runs about 3\u00a2 per piece. So the answer is: It's almost half the price - very worth it if you're just needing a lot of standard pieces. As a side note: We really liked the color choices Building Bricks made. They're perfect for expanding your Lego creation palette.",

They are fantastic, but the 1000 piece Educational set runs upward of $60, and the 800+ piece Classic set about $50. I've looked at bulk blocks but consistently found lackluster reviews normally stating \"Doesn't fit with Lego as advertised\" or \"pieces seem of lesser quality\". I stumbled upon Brickyard bricks and saw the tons of high reviews and also the great pricing. 1100 pieces for $30 is a STEAL. They arrived and the pieces are almost indistinguishable from Lego brand bricks. They fit with Lego bricks tight and seem of the same quality of material. The only discernable difference is the Brickyard bricks don't have the Lego name on the top studs of the bricks. Paired with the 10x10 inch baseplates (also very amazing products, even better than Lego brand ones), they are a great deal. Lots of bank for the buck! Highly recommend these sets for anyone looking to expand their building brick collections!",

It took about four hours total, although I probably could have cut that time in half if my kids weren't \"helping\" so much. I feel the Lego Architecture series has been hit and miss but this set and the White House are both top notch examples. The overall model looks great. I just have so much respect for the designers. The rotunda all by itself is mind-boggling and I love they way the handled the rows of pillars across the entry ways. Most of the exterior walls are built of 1x1 angular bricks, some facing inward to create rows of square windows, others facing outward to suggest arches & round windows. There is an interior space detailing the floor under the rotunda, including a circle of statues, that can be viewed by lifting the rotunda off; a nice little touch. The finished model is very impressive on display, 18\" wide and about 8\" high. One gripe & one suggestion. First my only complaint, the back side of the model does not have nearly the level of detail as the front and sides. This is a real pity because the actual Capital Building has some unique features on the front & rear faces, and I would like to see the designer tackle both. I'm sure this was a cost saving decision made to keep the price & piece-count down, but it's a shame that the model isn't equally detailed from all sides. And a suggestion: Unlike some large Lego projects, the bags in this kit are not numbered. This is a shame, as it's really nice to open one bag at a time and only deal with the pieces needed in the next few steps. So, before starting, get yourself several bowls and a baking tray, open all the bags and sort non-white pieces by color, sort the ocean of blue pieces by size and type. This will definitely pay off in reduced frustration as you work.",

(My thumbs were a bit raw after, though!) I bought this for $92 and a week later it was on sale for $60 something. It's a steal if you see it on sale, but even at MSRP I think it's a good buy. Lego is an expensive hobby to begin with, and Architecture aims for a more adult price point, and this is the best set in that line. It's a fair price, and comes in just under the 10 cents per piece mark. A word of caution - because almost all the pieces are white, do take care of where you place this model and try to keep it clean. White legos have a tendency to become discolored over time.",

And it has _____!\" In the blanks were items like \"another slide here! and a shower, and a hot tub, and it even has..!\" I don't remember the feature that was a surprise to her. I like all Lego sets, but this one was better designed, cramming in more features than expected.",

They're Legos and are really great for children to explore their imaginations. My daughter tend to use the larger pieces to build, not so much on the tiny pieces. There is A LOT of tiny pieces. They're so small that they can easily be mistaken as cookie crumbs and be vacuumed up. They are a pain in the butt because of how tiny they are. Trying to vacuum I literally have to go on my knees to make sure there aren't any pieces on the floor. We put all the pieces in a gallon sized ziploc bag and she would keep all the unused pieces in the bag. But accidents do happen and they sometimes do fall off the table. So just a heads up.

The alternate builds are both pretty fun, but the main robot build is where it's at. You can pick up the rocks, pose it balancing on one hand, adjust the eyes to get a bunch of expressions, and roll it all around! The tracked wheels are actually linked to a regular rubber wheel, meaning that the treads will spin if you move it over smooth OR rough surfaces! The light brick is integrated in unique ways for each of the three models, too, which can give some inspiration on all the different ways you can use one! The only real problem I have with the aesthetic and playability is the arm of the robot that has the light brick. That arm looks kind of stubby compared to the other one in some poses, and it doesn't articulate at the elbow at all. Not a huge problem though! As for parts, the main draw is obviously the light brick. This is a relatively inexpensive way to get one. The large number of pieces in this particular shade of blue is a huge bonus to me personally since it's one of my favorite part colors that LEGO makes, but it really isn't a super common color in general anyway. It's also a pretty good set to get if you want more of the tracks/treads. The Creator line of sets pretty much always come with a good variety of uncommon and common pieces for a relatively low price, and this one is no different in that respect. I bought this set for the parts, but honestly I don't want to take it apart! It's just so much fun to play with and pose, plus it looks adorable on display.

He's been playing with the built robot models as toys - they hold up well. While I'm always fascinated by the ways Lego has utilized the same pieces in different ways - my son actually noticed the creativity in using the light as eyes, a laser, and a jet boost - it got him thinking - which is priceless right? The instructions are easy enough he's able to follow them with a bit of help (at his age he had a much easier time with the dinosaur kit though.) As we both love to build - this has provided a great opportunity for us to work together, practice teamwork, and have lots of little teaching moments. :-) My only complaint (if you could call it that) is that the other sets have a \"secret\" 4th model if you go online - so far this just has the 3.",

He is really getting into dinosaurs at the moment, so this kit came at a perfect time. In order to construct each dinosaur, you pretty much have to take the previous one completely apart. It only takes a short time (less than an hour) to rebuild it though it may take younger kids more time. The dinosaurs are articulated very well. The legs, tails, and neck/heads all have hinge points. It makes it great fun to use in battle. We love the kit. The only thing that could make it better would be in Lego had offered it in a variety of colors.",

Even at ages 5 & 7 they are able to follow the directions, which are detailed, easy to follow, pictures. We started by building the ATV's first and of course the minifigs, (we lost the 5 yr old here, because the ATVs were just too much fun ). Then we built the truck and trailer. Once assembled it is a very sturdy piece, the kids drive the truck and trailer all around as well as the ATVs, and we have t lost any pieces.we have a lot of new sets and this is by far their favorite. I think we may need to purchase a second set !! Highly recommend.. fun for the whole family",

It's quite difficult to manipulate minifigs in either the cabin or the kitchen/service area, but food trucks are very cramped in real life too so in this case it makes sense. The 2 minifigures included are pretty basic - a pizza chef and a woman who is either a customer or a delivery driver (via the scooter, which I did not build). Her hair piece is so big that she can't turn her head or sit in the driver's seat. I have absolutely no clue why this set's instructions are spread across two booklets; kind of wasteful and just another thing to deal with on the table, but not an actual problem with the set.",

                "review_text": "OVERALL CONCLUSION ================== LEGO boost is 80% of the learning at 50% of the cost and 20% of the hassle of LEGO\u2019s fancier Mindstorms product. LEGO Boost compares really well to all other competing robots out there, so if you want your kid to know about coding, robotics, mechanics or technology, it\u2019s a really easy choice. The age range is spot-on: 7 to 12 years old seems just right. TOP PROS: 1) Great value for what you get; 2) Extensive models for a lot of fun; 3) Painless setup so that kids can use the app and Bluetooth connection easily. TOP CONS: 1) Needs an iPad or Android tablet, which can triple the cost; 2) Limited accessories and other sensors/motors so far; 3) App can be very confusing at times and the \u201cunlocking\u201d of levels is irritating WHAT CAN LEGO BOOST DO? ====================== You can build 5 different, intricate projects right out of the box. LEGO included a huge assortment of great parts so that you can build a standing robot, a guitar, a \u201cfactory\u201d, a cat, and a horizontal rover bot. Each model is part toy and part experiment because the app has included code that makes the characters lively and interactive while leaving room for customization. All the sounds and processing is done by your tablet, so that\u2019s a smart way to save costs and make the \u201cbrain\u201d brick really simple (which LEGO calls the \u201cMove Hub\u201d). The LEGO Boost app guides you through building and programming each robot in a set of challenges that are unlocked as you go. My 7-year-old and I could only figure out how to do Vernie the tall robot so far, which was sad because he wanted to start with the guitar or factory. This is minor bump in the road, though, because I envision this being a popular toy for a very long time. The fact that the Bluetooth setup was so painless (no pairing on iOS, it was like magic) makes this much easier to deal with than other robots like Cozmo. NOTE: If your app crashes, power off your iPad completely. This worked great for me. I\u2019ve noticed that upon installation, some apps need a power cycle to work their best. I don\u2019t know if this is a memory leak in the iPad or what. I\u2019m running the app on a 3-year-old iPad Air 1 (not 2) and it works great. Anything newer should be fine, and LEGO has a device check section on their website. IS LEGO BOOST FUN AND EDUCATIONAL? ================================ For sure, this product is a ton of fun and teaches a lot about coding/logic, problem-solving, and creativity. My younger two kids, ages 4 and 7, are over-the-moon-excited about it and have been counting down the days until it arrived on August 1st. My 7-year-old already spent three hours building the first robot and he was completely enthralled. I was especially impressed by the robot\u2019s head motion and the intricacy of the gears used in this model. The app has been fun to go through, but we\u2019re only partially through it right now. HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO OTHER ROBOTS? ================================== As you can see from my website, LearnRichly, I\u2019m kind of a learning toy nut. I especially like logic games and programming, so robotics coding is a pretty natural fit. In our house, we have Cozmo (from Anki), Dash (Wonder Workshop), Ozobot, and *3* LEGO Mindstorms kits (the older kids do FIRST Lego League, so they\u2019ve acquired 2 EV3 sets and 1 NXT set). (Ouch, I just realized that I\u2019ve spent over $1000 in toy robots in the last 5 years, yikes. We don\u2019t eat-out or see shows more than a few time per year, so that helps save cash!) UPDATE: See more below about Cozmo in the 8/15 Update.. Which robot do we like the best? So far, LEGO Boost and Dash are the winners, with an edge towards LEGO if you have kids 8 and up and a recommendation for Dash if you have younger kids. Cozmo is small and limited, but more emotive and fun. He\u2019s definitely a \u201ctoy\u201d and the others are \u201clearning toys.\u201d Oddly, he\u2019s also capable of real Python programming after a complicated SDK setup, so it\u2019s an eclectic mix. Ozobots are only really useful for the most price-constrained budget; save up and buy a Boost, instead. Why are Dash and Boost the best? Because they give you real coding experience and make it fun. Dash has several apps available and is generally more mature as of right now, but I think Boost should catch up and exceed Dash overall. They both can take LEGO parts for building, but LEGO far and away exceeds Dash in versatility. It can be a factory, guitar, cat or who-knows-what-else that\u2019s coming in the future! I do appreciate Dash as a standalone, start-from-scratch project, but LEGO will be the better choice for most households. Dash has been alone in this space for quite a while, but probably just got dethroned. UPDATE ON AUGUST 15th, 2017 ========================== OK, we've had LEGO Boost for 2 weeks now. We've built the standing robot, the guitar, and the mini-factory. We couldn't get the factory to work and must have done something wrong--we'll come back to it. My son wants to build the rover next. We also had to buy a large organizer set to keep all the pieces--what I didn't realize is how many *unique* pieces there are in this set. The Mindstorms kits have lots of pieces, but they are easier to organize since there are fewer than 100 unique ones. LEGO Boost has over 200 different types of pieces; we ended up using about 60 little divided bins in plastic craft organizers. If I had it to do over again I would buy the Akro Mills 64-drawer organizer like this one: Akro-Mils 64-drawer organizer . They charge too much for the drawer dividers, but I believe another company (stack-on?) has a 48-pack for much cheaper that *supposedly* works with the Akro Mills set, but I haven't verified. Since I wrote the above about Cozmo from Anki, I realize that he now has coding in the app! It's pretty good, too, so he's now much more competitive with LEGO Boost. I will review all of them in a future roundup at my little hobby blog LearnRichly.com, but for now I at least have an in-depth review of LEGO Boost that gives you much more detail than I could put in this Amazon review. Using my 6-criteria scoring scale, the average I came up with was a 4.4 out of 5 stars, so I wish Amazon would allow me to award LEGO Boost a 4.5 star rating instead of my 5 star rating.",

My kid (7) loves it and it is a great introduction to robotics and programming. The app is well presented given the vast set of capabilities. They did a good job forcing you to take a gradual approach to learning by \"unlocking\" capabilities as you learn them. That said, there are two issues that others have reported as well. The product is so new that there is no help available with a google search. The problems: 1. The program freezes after the first motion instruction. This is very annoying as you have to restart the app, and it has a long start-up time. Then it works for a few runs and starts freezing again. 2. The programming steps, represented as icons are not documented. Most are obvious (move forward, move back, etc). Others are completely cryptic. Usually you can figure it out just by trying it, but others still remain a mystery or their effect is unclear. Another peeve is that the sound emanates from the tablet, not the robot. They should have added a speaker. I have emailed Lego support on the two issues above. I'll update this review with their response when I get it. EDIT: Lego customer support responded within 24 hours with a thorough email that included a PDF with a \"cheat sheet\" for all of the programming blocks (a.k.a. \"icons\"). Regarding the freezing program issue: they claim to be unaware of it. After some testing here, I'm thinking it might be radio interference with nearby routers and cellphones. I moved to a different room and the issue virtually disappeared. I communicated this to Lego. I'll continue updating with any new information I get from them.",

Keep the order and you will not have any problems. The pieces are fairly sturdy after assembly so you do not have to worry about it falling apart. I was actually really surprised by the sheer size of the lego set. It is not something you can just put on the corner of your desk because the wings are long. They are about 12 inches if not more just from end to end. So if you are planning to put it on a shelf know that it will take a good amount of space. It has a shooting mechanism to shoot two darts from the bottom of the tie fighter. It also comes with 4 lego figures. Kylo, stormtrooper, pilot, and a droid. The details on the stormtrooper and pilot are great! The helmet is huge but very detailed. Overall I was very happy with this. It has great deal, easy to assemble(took about 3 hours), and very detailed in design.",

A realistic LEGO Saturn V rocket that stands 39 inches tall with detachable stages, lunar lander and printed microfigure astronauts. I thought I'd died and gone to LEGO heaven! LEGO could have easily charged $200 for this set but kept the price tag at $119.99 which is probably why it sold out almost immediately, almost everywhere. I got mine direct from Amazon and not a reseller because I got in very early on June 1st and it has been out of stock since but I have seen supplies coming and going at my local LEGO Store. Build took 3 hours 18 minutes (see my unboxing, speed build and review video) and was challenging - not one for the younger kids. Pay careful instructions to the manual as mistakes made early on can be painful to replicate (note the use of pliers in my speed build). The finished result is an unbelievable masterpiece of LEGO engineering and a fitting tribute to the pioneers that took one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind. Check out my video review to see every aspect of the set reviewed in detail.",

In my case, it's the perfect father and son build. (It's also great for father-daughter, mother-son/daughter, or just any person who likes to build Lego!) It has some creative building and a lot of great little details. It has a high piece count for the price. And it's a crazy moon rocket! What can possibly compete? I got the frustration-free packaging and was worried that it wouldn't come with the normal Lego box. That concerned me because I wanted the full experience for this set. Thankfully, the frustration free box is a box just big enough to hold the whole set including the regular box. It's shipped in this frustration-free box which is good and bad. It's good because it protects the set without the need of a huge box and padding. It's bad because while it doesn't say what set is inside, it does say \"Lego\" and \"Toys\" all over the box. It was ok, but my children really wondered what was in the box which reduced the surprise. But I don't care how it came--the set is mine! It's 100% worth the hype. I strongly suggest this model. Lego has said they will keep making more through 2018, so you should be able to buy it without paying scalper prices. But I suggest you keep watching Amazon and other retailers and buy one for yourself!",

It is a new release and very popular, sold out on Amazon and the LEGO site as soon as it was available. It should be in stock at the regular price again once they catch up to demand, so don't shell out extra money to these third party \"marketplace\" sellers unless you have money to burn and don't care about wasting it.

The finished set is very tall (or long depending on how you choose to display), unless you choose to display as separate booster units. Instructions were easy to understand, and the booklet is the size of a magazine and contains some really great supplementary material about the Apollo mission, pictures, and information about the process of design and build of both the real thing and the lego version.

So to encourage him to work on his very simple Lego set I bought myself this BB-8 set. I was completely ignorant as to how much Lego\u2019s had advanced. When I opened the BB-8 box I was stunned and in shock. I am 47 and I have not 'played' with Lego's in a very, very long time so I got him a very simple set and I bought this 'hell monster' that I love & am still working on, so I give it 5 Stars because it is awesome and it is not Lego\u2019s of old, when I opened it \u201cIt\u2019s a trap!\u201d were the first words that popped into my head! If you are an older person do not buy Lego's blindly. REALLY read the description and prepare yourself for the shock! LOL. It truly is an amazing project and it is looking beautiful so far. If you enjoy a challenge I highly recommend. BTW my dad hasn't even touched his little truck Lego. SMH",

                "review_text": "OVERALL CONCLUSION ================== LEGO boost is 80% of the learning at 50% of the cost and 20% of the hassle of LEGO\u2019s fancier Mindstorms product. LEGO Boost compares really well to all other competing robots out there, so if you want your kid to know about coding, robotics, mechanics or technology, it\u2019s a really easy choice. The age range is spot-on: 7 to 12 years old seems just right. TOP PROS: 1) Great value for what you get; 2) Extensive models for a lot of fun; 3) Painless setup so that kids can use the app and Bluetooth connection easily. TOP CONS: 1) Needs an iPad or Android tablet, which can triple the cost; 2) Limited accessories and other sensors/motors so far; 3) App can be very confusing at times and the \u201cunlocking\u201d of levels is irritating WHAT CAN LEGO BOOST DO? ====================== You can build 5 different, intricate projects right out of the box. LEGO included a huge assortment of great parts so that you can build a standing robot, a guitar, a \u201cfactory\u201d, a cat, and a horizontal rover bot. Each model is part toy and part experiment because the app has included code that makes the characters lively and interactive while leaving room for customization. All the sounds and processing is done by your tablet, so that\u2019s a smart way to save costs and make the \u201cbrain\u201d brick really simple (which LEGO calls the \u201cMove Hub\u201d). The LEGO Boost app guides you through building and programming each robot in a set of challenges that are unlocked as you go. My 7-year-old and I could only figure out how to do Vernie the tall robot so far, which was sad because he wanted to start with the guitar or factory. This is minor bump in the road, though, because I envision this being a popular toy for a very long time. The fact that the Bluetooth setup was so painless (no pairing on iOS, it was like magic) makes this much easier to deal with than other robots like Cozmo. NOTE: If your app crashes, power off your iPad completely. This worked great for me. I\u2019ve noticed that upon installation, some apps need a power cycle to work their best. I don\u2019t know if this is a memory leak in the iPad or what. I\u2019m running the app on a 3-year-old iPad Air 1 (not 2) and it works great. Anything newer should be fine, and LEGO has a device check section on their website. IS LEGO BOOST FUN AND EDUCATIONAL? ================================ For sure, this product is a ton of fun and teaches a lot about coding/logic, problem-solving, and creativity. My younger two kids, ages 4 and 7, are over-the-moon-excited about it and have been counting down the days until it arrived on August 1st. My 7-year-old already spent three hours building the first robot and he was completely enthralled. I was especially impressed by the robot\u2019s head motion and the intricacy of the gears used in this model. The app has been fun to go through, but we\u2019re only partially through it right now. HOW DOES IT COMPARE TO OTHER ROBOTS? ================================== As you can see from my website, LearnRichly, I\u2019m kind of a learning toy nut. I especially like logic games and programming, so robotics coding is a pretty natural fit. In our house, we have Cozmo (from Anki), Dash (Wonder Workshop), Ozobot, and *3* LEGO Mindstorms kits (the older kids do FIRST Lego League, so they\u2019ve acquired 2 EV3 sets and 1 NXT set). (Ouch, I just realized that I\u2019ve spent over $1000 in toy robots in the last 5 years, yikes. We don\u2019t eat-out or see shows more than a few time per year, so that helps save cash!) UPDATE: See more below about Cozmo in the 8/15 Update.. Which robot do we like the best? So far, LEGO Boost and Dash are the winners, with an edge towards LEGO if you have kids 8 and up and a recommendation for Dash if you have younger kids. Cozmo is small and limited, but more emotive and fun. He\u2019s definitely a \u201ctoy\u201d and the others are \u201clearning toys.\u201d Oddly, he\u2019s also capable of real Python programming after a complicated SDK setup, so it\u2019s an eclectic mix. Ozobots are only really useful for the most price-constrained budget; save up and buy a Boost, instead. Why are Dash and Boost the best? Because they give you real coding experience and make it fun. Dash has several apps available and is generally more mature as of right now, but I think Boost should catch up and exceed Dash overall. They both can take LEGO parts for building, but LEGO far and away exceeds Dash in versatility. It can be a factory, guitar, cat or who-knows-what-else that\u2019s coming in the future! I do appreciate Dash as a standalone, start-from-scratch project, but LEGO will be the better choice for most households. Dash has been alone in this space for quite a while, but probably just got dethroned. UPDATE ON AUGUST 15th, 2017 ========================== OK, we've had LEGO Boost for 2 weeks now. We've built the standing robot, the guitar, and the mini-factory. We couldn't get the factory to work and must have done something wrong--we'll come back to it. My son wants to build the rover next. We also had to buy a large organizer set to keep all the pieces--what I didn't realize is how many *unique* pieces there are in this set. The Mindstorms kits have lots of pieces, but they are easier to organize since there are fewer than 100 unique ones. LEGO Boost has over 200 different types of pieces; we ended up using about 60 little divided bins in plastic craft organizers. If I had it to do over again I would buy the Akro Mills 64-drawer organizer like this one: Akro-Mils 64-drawer organizer . They charge too much for the drawer dividers, but I believe another company (stack-on?) has a 48-pack for much cheaper that *supposedly* works with the Akro Mills set, but I haven't verified. Since I wrote the above about Cozmo from Anki, I realize that he now has coding in the app! It's pretty good, too, so he's now much more competitive with LEGO Boost. I will review all of them in a future roundup at my little hobby blog LearnRichly.com, but for now I at least have an in-depth review of LEGO Boost that gives you much more detail than I could put in this Amazon review. Using my 6-criteria scoring scale, the average I came up with was a 4.4 out of 5 stars, so I wish Amazon would allow me to award LEGO Boost a 4.5 star rating instead of my 5 star rating.",

My kid (7) loves it and it is a great introduction to robotics and programming. The app is well presented given the vast set of capabilities. They did a good job forcing you to take a gradual approach to learning by \"unlocking\" capabilities as you learn them. That said, there are two issues that others have reported as well. The product is so new that there is no help available with a google search. The problems: 1. The program freezes after the first motion instruction. This is very annoying as you have to restart the app, and it has a long start-up time. Then it works for a few runs and starts freezing again. 2. The programming steps, represented as icons are not documented. Most are obvious (move forward, move back, etc). Others are completely cryptic. Usually you can figure it out just by trying it, but others still remain a mystery or their effect is unclear. Another peeve is that the sound emanates from the tablet, not the robot. They should have added a speaker. I have emailed Lego support on the two issues above. I'll update this review with their response when I get it. EDIT: Lego customer support responded within 24 hours with a thorough email that included a PDF with a \"cheat sheet\" for all of the programming blocks (a.k.a. \"icons\"). Regarding the freezing program issue: they claim to be unaware of it. After some testing here, I'm thinking it might be radio interference with nearby routers and cellphones. I moved to a different room and the issue virtually disappeared. I communicated this to Lego. I'll continue updating with any new information I get from them.",

Im still not done, but coming up on about 18 hours. If you are like me and grew up with legos and love star wars, but only got the sets that your parents could afford to get you but always coveted the big expensive ones, then this is definitely up your alley. Time consuming, fun to build, and incredibly detailed. I had been waiting for this thing to be available for about 8 months, and as soon as i saw it was in stock, i jumped on it. THIS is a true collectors item for both Lego and Star Wars fans. The only dilemma i have right now is where i am going to put it. If you are a parent, and thinking about buying this for your kids, think twice because this is NOT a toy. I have two kids but bought this for myself. It would definitely be a great family build project though. This build has so far been tedious, but an absolute blast and i cant wait for the finished product!",

This kit is huge. It took my 3 boys and me over 18 days to complete it on a part-time basis. We took out time building it because we enjoy the entire build process. It is pretty cool the way it's designed. It has a Techniques internal frame and the armor plates rest on top of the frame. I wish they designed the armor plates to attach to the frame to make it a stress bearing piece and adding to the overall rigidity of the model but alas they did not. When you finally place all the armor on top of the frame it will cause the frame to flex hence you cannot just pick up the model but you will have to carry it a certain way if you want to move it. Of course I'm just nit-picking, make no mistake this is an awesome model and an engineering miracle. I love it and it's totally worth it.",

There is a sense of pride and accomplishment to seeing it slowly take shape and when it's finally done, it's almost sad because the work is over. Can't wait for the next Ultimate Star Wars Lego set.

I really enjoyed this one, as I build the architecture series of places that I (and/or my family) have seen. This one is different from the others in that it really gives height to the set, which allows for the folds of fabric in the statue to be seen and explored.

And connecting the hotel & water park is the very nifty working monorail. With four friends figures, tons of bright colorful pieces (over a thousand), and plenty of playable elements, this is a set that provides plenty of building fun and a lot of lasting play value. We've had no small number of Lego sets over the years from many different Lego themes (Classic, City, Batgirl, and even one other Friends set) , but my daughter has liked this one the best.

Once finished, the resort has plenty of play details, with the monorail, slides, and various shops. This set isn\u2019t overly sturdy; if you want to move it after construction, I recommend having an adult do it. The monorail track fell off when I tried to move mine. Easy enough to fix, but it might be disappointing for kids to see. Perhaps my expectations (and preferences) are high, considering I normally construct Star Wars, Harry Potter, Ideas, and Architecture sets. I didn\u2019t find Heartlake City Resort a particularly enjoyable build. It\u2019s easy and repetitive. If I were to buy a set for a gift, I\u2019d want it to demonstrate different building techniques or at least be fun to construct. I also didn\u2019t like the large number of stickers.

I love that different units came in different bags so we could get her to take a break when a section was completed. She built the entire thing herself with help only a couple of times to help her find small pieces that got dropped into the carpet in her room. Now that it is complete, she and her sister have fun with all the characters.

There's a monorail, emphasis on the word \"mono\" as the rail only fits one LEGO friend and it goes around in circles. A little more exciting are the water slides with a \"splash bucket\" full of clear blue LEGO pieces. The set includes four figures, including a rare boy. The figures can be mixed and matched, although their skin color and gender limits this somewhat. Even more exciting than a male figure is the inclusion of a dolphin! Technically, this is a hotel, but there's only two places to sleep, which brings up some interesting questions as to who stays where. There's a telephone (really?), computer, juice bar, and the all-important roof terrace with DJ decks. There's also changing rooms and a restaurant, but the action is really out on the water: a water scooter with detachable parasailer, windsurf boar, and lifeguard stand. There's plenty of tiny pieces to play with (and lose) too. Everything you would expect for a resort is here, including bowls, cups, hot dogs, fruit, ice cream, keys, luggage and even a walkie-talkie. This set is more focused on experiences than reproducing a structure, and given that the water is mostly implied (with the exception of that splash bucket), it really opens up the set. If your child likes LEGO and vacations (who doesn't), this set is worth the investment.",

It is very beautiful architecture like a cathedral. The mini figures are a must also like Professor McGonagall, Quirrel, Hagrid, Nearly headless Nick, Susan Bones etc. I also like the Phoenix. The basilisk, although short, but it\u2019s good enough. I like scabbers and Hedwig, but I don\u2019t see Crookshanks so I got a Hermione w/ Crookshanks mini figure. The price is a bit high.

                "review_text": "This set was fun to build, and pretty straight-forward too. The pictures-only manual only led me astray once (the strangely fiddly hinges for the top of the tower, that didn't seem to line up at first...), and it's strangely addictive, as some parts were mystifying while being put together, and only made sense once you actually put them into the rest of the model. I did have a couple of minor niggles: I was missing a piece! A single, one-piece block, that appeared in the instructions, but was absent from the set. It was for the base of one of the buttresses on the outside of the hall, and while I ended up with a couple of pieces among the extras I could have used, I didn't know at the time if they were needed for something else! There was another case of one of the pieces being a different color than the manual indicated, but that was it, apart from that, it all went together pretty nicely. The finished model is wonderful, even if not all the bits seem built entirely to the same scale. The inclusion of 10 mini-figures means you can recreate most scenes from the films, even if getting Quirrel, but not Snape seems a bit odd. It's a little disappointing that there's only room for two of the four house banners to be hung up (though both are double-sided, so you can pick which ones you want to display), and it's not easy to reach inside the Hall once it's put together to get figures into it, but littler builders with smaller hands will have no problems. Overall, a fun set to build, and display. My only real complaint was that I wish it was bigger, and more complete version of the Hogwarts Castle, but I'm not a Lego fanatic, so I could have missed that, or maybe it's coming in the future?",

I've read a lot of reviews by people who are serious lego collectors who were not happy with this set. These are people that know all of the different characters, pieces, etc. I am not that person. My kids love building and playing with them so my knowledge is limited to how much they enjoy them. I can tell you that this is a hit with them.

In keeping with the tradition, I gave our youngest her Advent Calendar this evening (Friends version) - boy was this a disappointment (for me more than her I think). The box was manufactured upside down, meaning when you open the \"flap\" on the front (ie: the play area), the entire calendar is upside down. It kind of defeats the purpose of having something you look at and look forward to opening daily. You know what I mean: You look forward to getting \"people\" and \"winter/seasonal\" things to play with each day. I've updated my initial review as I've communicated with Lego support. Apparently this is the \"new approach\" by Lego. Meaning take everything that you were used to in years past and just change it with the Friends set. I don't know if \"Friends\" cost more to make than bricks, but you won't find any \"Friends\" in this set. The idea of \"play\" also seems to be lost on this set as you are really just making ornaments. I order these in September so that I have them for the kids. I would have returned it, but of course I'm way outside of the return window. If you like the Friends sets from years past, you might be disappointed. Of course, if you want to make ornaments for the tree - you might love it! This really should just be called the Lego Ornament Set. You may have fun putting them together, but it is not at all like the sets of years past. I could live with that, except that it is marketed besides the other Advent Calendars and appears to be the only one to receive this new approach. Sorry - don't mean to be a HumBug - just not what we were expecting and clearly Lego had absolutely no intent of losing potential buyers by marketing the product for what it really is - \"NOT Lego Friends\".",

Build times will vary, but it took my 9 year old about a week of work, on and off. Once built, this set (unlike some others) offers a ton of play value to a young Star Wars fan, and it goes from being a STEM toy to being an imagination/creativity toy, as they use the minifigs, fighter plane, and tower to create imaginative stories. There are not a ton of moving parts (which any kid will tell you are the fun parts) but there are enough, and there are even working \"weapons\" on the fighter and the gunner on the turret. If I had any complaint it's that it's fairly monochromatic (so much gray and black), but my kid doesn't mind and that makes it more realistic.
