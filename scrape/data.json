                "review_text": "I needed a pair of hiking boots to replace the Keene boots that were only 1 1/2 yrs old but not only lost their waterproofing in the first six months but had a weed stalk in the field go right through the side and almost break my skin. This was the second pair of Keene\u2019s that had gone bad in just over a year and, at $130 I was getting tired of replacing them. Started looking at reviews and found these. They have a large toe box with plenty of room. Before I took them out I took another reviewers advice and put a coating of Mink Oil on them. They were comfortable but I knew they\u2019d take a little break in. I now have about three or four miles of walking through the fields and surprisingly they seem to be breaking in rather quickly. I usually put on about 500-700 miles a year. One note, if you\u2019re looking for hiking boots that will give you really good ankle support these ARE NOT for you, look elsewhere. These are for easy hiking, fields and roadway. When I got them I first put in a pair of Dr. Scholls and that went a long way toward making them immediately comfortable. If I remember I\u2019ll give an update in three or four months. UPDATE: Jan. 6, 2018 - I\u2019ve now had a chance to wear these for a while including the recent snow storm and frigid temps (at least for us). We got 5\u201d of snow, temps this morning, when I took the dog out, we\u2019re 4 or 5 degrees with a windchill of -8. I had been wearing wool socks with these and my feet have stayed warm and dry on a 25 to 35 min. walk through the fields. This time, with the snow and frigid windchill I decided to try just summer cotton socks. Bear in mind I\u2019m a 70 year old with diabetes, which does affect circulation, so I\u2019m pretty sensitive to cold and heat and the comfort of my foot wear. (I walk approximately 3 miles a day with my dog, even in the snow and cold unless it\u2019s too much for her.) So, the results of a 20 minute walk were still warm and dry feet. I could have gone much further but Harley was getting snow turning to ice between her toes every few minutes and we\u2019d have to stop and I\u2019d have to remove it. Bottom line: When I received these boots I put in my Dr. Scholls insoles from my previous pair, rubbed in three coats of mink oil on dry days (which I think was key to waterproofing) and started walking. I\u2019ve found them to be far more comfortable than the Keen\u2019s I was previously wearing. I don\u2019t walk as much as a lot of people, about 25 miles a week, but they\u2019re doing well for me for field and neighborhood walking. 2/9/18: I like to keep folks updated on important stuff: If you want a pair of boots to wear, every day, and forget when you take them off, look elsewhere. Because these are leather they require a LOT of care. If they get soaking wet do NOT continue to wear them the next day, you\u2019ll ruin them. I\u2019ve found that when mine get soaked from walking in the pouring rain, in the field with my dog, I wipe them clean with an old towel, put shoe trees in them to keep the leather from shrinking and set them aside where there\u2019s a flow of air to let them air dry. Do not try and force dry them with hot air, you\u2019ll ruin the leather. Putting them a few feet away from a fan seems to work okay or just let them sit. While they\u2019re drying I use an old pair that I kept. After they have dried completely I retreat every inch of leather, paying particular attention to seams and around grommets, with mink oil, let it sit and dry then retreat again. Is the above a pain? Yes it is but these appear to be quality boots and you need to take care of them, not let them get muddy and wet and toss them in the corner for the next day.",

Except for a couple of quick-lace eyelet failures, the old pair have stayed together & decently waterproof. They were made in Vietnam. The new pair, again same size & style were made in China. After wearing less than an hour the inside of by heels began to burn and on the way to blistering. I compared dial caliper measurements of the heel width & found the Chinese model heel 1/8\" more narrow than the old pair & explains a correspondingly smaller upper. Outsourcing to the cheapest manufacturer isn't always the best option if you want to maintain your reputation. If I wanted cheap, there's a wally world on every corner, same boot at half price, minus the label. But hey, they cut that corner too, no Timberland embroidery stitching in the tongue! Anything to save a buck! Disappointed...",

HOWEVER, after just my fourth day of wearing these boots one of the riveted eyelets on the left boot broke and came out of the leather hole, so now I have to take it to shoe repair to get fixed (hopefully). If they can't fix it reasonably I'm sending them back. A shame because these are very comfortable boots. I should not have to pay for a repair because of shoddy craftsmanship.

For the Timberland White Ledge boots the feeling is the latter. These boots might be ok for a casual hike or two but CAN NOT hold up to daily repetitive use. I purchased these boots on Nov 8th 2017 for daily use at work, I am on my feet 8 hours a day walking and interacting with customers and wanted something a little more supportive than \"running shoes\" In that area these boots are great, comfortable, supportive and my feet were not sore or tired at the end of a day. But after less than 2 weeks of use the front toe area where the leather upper meets the thicker rubber part of the sole started to separate. Within 4 weeks the boots were completely unusable due to the worsening of the separation. Thinking I might have gotten a pair with weak glue, I purchased another pair but after 2 weeks the new pair is also doing the same. This is happening on both feet with daily use, just walking, I am not in construction or hiking on rough rocks yet the toe area can not stay together. I have heard Timberland has a 1-year warranty if the boots fail during normal use but considering this has happened to two pairs both within a month of daily use I would not recommend unless you potentially want to be replacing your boots every month.",

With a little ingenuity and a few tools I was able to clip off the sharp point and pound down the hazard. I know this seller allows for returns but my daughter wanted to wear them that night, so I figured I'd suck it up and fix them myself. But overall, I'm sure this one little mistake is not common, and the boots got lots of nice comments from her friends.

                "review_text": "These are very good looking & a nice quality for under $30. I bought the tan & the taupe. I was going to decide between them and send one pair back. I prefer the taupe color but I really like both so I am going to keep both pair. I just might get a pair in black too. Its true that there is no arch support, but i'm flat-footed and high arches hurt my feet. I definitely prefer a flatter sole, so no problem there....the foot-bed is not cushioned and I thought that might hurt my feet, but I wore medium-thickness cushioned socks and walked around campus quite a bit today with no discomfort at all. I have picky feet that get sore easily so I was pleasantly surprised. I saw that a few reviewers had an issue with nails sticking up out of the foot-bed (eek!) so I made sure to check carefully before sticking my feet in. No nails in either pair---phew!....The only flaw that I found is that one of the snaps of the folded cuff (taupe color, inner part of the right shoe) will not stay snapped. It seems to be mis-positioned and pops open every time I try to snap it. But this isn't a problem for me because you can't even tell. The folded part stays down just fine without the snaps. My boot size is usually anywhere from 7-8 because sizing can be so inconsistent from brand to brand. I have a few pair of Sorel boots (in the old-school whole sizes they used prior to coming out with the 1/2 sizes) that are a U.S. women's size 7, but my normal running/trainer shoe size is a U.S. women's 8 (in new balance, asics & Sanuk brands). I decided to go with size 8 for these boots and i'm glad I did. They fit perfectly. There is enough room for thicker socks without feeling like my feet are squeezed in, but I also tried them on at home with thinner socks & they don't slip or feel too big. They really do fit perfectly for me. :)",

Rarely can I find all four qualities unless I buy minimalist shoes, but then I won't get the good traction or warmth in the winter. These Columbia Minx offer warmth and traction, but the insole has about an inch high! The ball of the foot is about 1/4 inch, so my heel is elevated about the ball of my foot by 3/4 of an inch. If you take out the insole, these appear to be zero drop. They\u2019re flexible even with the shoe liner and from what my friend who owns a pair says they get more flexible over time, which is a plus for me. There is a little toe spring (seems tough to avoid in most shoes). I can fit my feet in the boot while wearing my Correct Toes\u2122 without squishing my feet, but just barely. They have just the right amount of room without the liners. Check out how they measure up to the shoe liner test (see below); I\u2019m spilling over the edge a bit. Ideally, your foot should not spill over the edge of the liner. For reference, the widest part of my foot is 4 inches and I ordered the size 8 boot. I might return them for an 8 1/2 and replace the shoe liner with a flat one. I wish these were sold in wide or did not have a tapered toe. Pros: Warm (-25 degrees F), flexible, waterproof and zero drop without the liners, light, good traction. Cons: elevated heel toe liner, a tad narrow, has a toe spring.",

I can slip them on and off in a second. I sized up a half size to wear wool socks underneath and it is just right. With wool socks my feet actually get hot and I live in a COLD place. I wear them to walk my dogs and run errands, so no I have not done anything such as backpacking or standing outside all day, but for my needs they are perfect. Also, I decided to order despite people saying that they are not waterproof. Having grown up in the midwest I don't know how anyone could expect a fabric boot to be entirely waterproof. For wet and slush you would need something else--a big rubbery boot, likely. The advantage of this is it's light as air and really comfy. It feels like a moccasin. This is better for drier conditions such as when it is very cold. My two cents.",

                "review_text": "These are just sort of Mehhh boots. At an original price of $130, I expect them to be ridiculously amazing. Paying $80, I still expect them to be amazing. They are just sort of \"okay\". Not as cute as I'd hoped and nowhere near as warm as I had hoped. All the reviews I read said size up a whole size, I disagree. I wear a 7.5 or 8 depending on the shoe, and I always buy a 9 in running shoes to give my feet room to swell on runs. So I figured a 9 in these would be fine, especially since everyone said they run so small. They are way too big! My left foot is a bit smaller than my right, so I'm used to the left shoe always feeling a tad bit loose, however, strangely, the left fits fine and the right is huge, my heel slips in it. If I put on an extra thick pair of socks it helps, but I think sizing up only a half size would be plenty. As for warmth, I was used to wearing a pair of Rockies hunting boots that were so insulated I could slip my bare feet in them and run around in -15 temps and still have toasty warm toes (sadly the soles started to separate and I had to break down and get new boots. I tried to get cute AND warm, but I guess you really can't have the best of both worlds.) This morning I put these boots on over my nylons and headed out into the roughly 10 degree morning. While not freezing, my feet were definitely chilly. So I'm not buying the -25 degree rating they come with. So, if you get a killer deal, sure, buy them. If you are looking for cute, eh, they're okay. If you're looking for super warm, look elsewhere.",

The difference in the details are: The Pascals leather is softer, with a slight pebbly finish, and the top (around your ankle) is a tiny bit shorter, and the leather is just cut off - making it more pliable, so it doesn't rub your ankle/leg. The 1460s are a stiffer leather with a smoother, shinier finish, and have a sewn hem type edging along the top. When she wore the 1460s she noticed two things. The top edging rubbed her leg just above the ankle, and her heel slipped and rubbed painfully where the heel cup and shaft join - right on her achilles. The size on the Pascals were comparable to the 1460s, but the Pascals were a tiny bit narrower, and more compact, making them look slightly more refined (not as combat looking). She liked both shoes, but chose the Pascals for three reasons - no painful break-in period; finish of the leather; and it was easier to return the 1460's purchased at a local store (rather than shipping back to Amazon seller). Hope this helps if you are trying to decide....",

I went with the 8W (not to be confused with Wide, the W stands for womens). I sized down because I didn't want extra room in my boot. I tend to prefer my shoes on the tighter side, plus I was concerned the extra room would cause blisters from friction and movement (as my Frye boots did when I ordered a size up). These boots are BEAUTIFUL. Exactly as I remembered from my pair I owned in high school. They fit tight on first wear, especially where the tongue meets the boot (the seam). So I wore wet wool socks for 3 hours in them to soften em up and form them to my feet. My left foot a slightly bigger than my right so this shoe fits tighter but not horribly uncomfortable at all. I wore them with regular socks last night for 5 hours and they fit AWESOME already. No discomfort at all. Super fast and easy to break in when it comes to a leather boot. My Fryes took months to break in and quite honestly, they still aren't nearly as comfortable at these. I'd feel confident wearing these all day or to walk around in alot. LOVE LOVE THEM.",

The Pascals are a much softer leather and do not cut into the top of your ankles as the 1480's tend to when breaking in. A much tighter fit when lacing it up as well which I appreciate since I have narrower feet. The heel and tip of shoes are very sturdy and not soft like the top half which is wonderful for its durability. I plan on getting a pair in every color that's how much I loves these! *I am a true 8.5 and I would recommend if you are a 8 or 8.5 to get these for sure.

I was going to buy the gothic purple color, but after seeing it was more gray, I decided to get the red one. I had a cobbler stretch them out for me, not because they were tight, but because they were stiff. They will need a little more breaking in, but it will not be as painful as going through the whole process on your own. I am usually a US size 8 in flats, and 8.5 in sneakers and boots to accomodate the thicker socks.I have slender feet, and my feet were swimming in my regular size size 8, even with the thick socks I wore the day I tried them on. The staff at the store said I should size down to UK size 5. Your feet will hurt, and it will be a pain to break them in. Just be patient. Go to a shoe repair shop, and let them stretch it out for you. It's an investment, the last pair I owned, a unisex 1460, lasted 10 years before they finally gave in, and my local cobbler advised me to donate them.",

I've gotten a few pairs of Docs in the past that never really fit right -- I was going by the fit guide on the websites that say if you normally wear a size 8 in U.S. shoes, you should order a size 6 in U.K. shoes. What the size guides don't tell you (and honestly, how could they know?) is that if you wear a size 8 in CHEAP SHOES you probably really only wear a size 7 in GOOD SHOES. At least that's what I've decided. This time I ordered the size 5 in the red Docs and prayed I wasn't making a mistake and would have to return them. When they arrived I put them on and yowza -- they fit great! No more heel-slippage, no more futzing with a variety of shoe inserts and bulky socks, just sheer wonderfulness. To be totally honest, I did have to do a little stretching on the right shoe, but that's because my right foot has always been a little bit bigger than my left. A lot of people have asked Doc Martens to offer half-sizes and I agree, but meanwhile some shoe balm and one of those shoe-stretch thingies works too.",

But I just love the feeling and look of these boots. You can fold down the top to a bootie boot. They are just so cute. I wore them only once and already got a compliment on them. Well now we have been dumped on with lots of snow. I have found out that the boots not only do not keep your feet warm, but they are not waterproof. If you purchase these boots, don't forget to purchase some waterproof spray. But overall the boots are so cute and soft to ware. Just remember to order one size bigger.

They are easy to put on and take off, and I often wear them all day. I'm not sure if they have an actual arch support, but the thick lining makes my feet comfortable anyway. The price was excellent, too. They seem to be pretty well waterproof, but if I walk through a mud puddle, the dirt sticks to them and I have to brush it off when it dries - it doesn't slide off like it would on a really waterproof boot.

The only reason I got these is because I am pregnant and will be delivering in March, and these were the only boots I could find that have a decent bottom on the boot, so the risk of slipping is not as bad. As far as quality goes, they are a bit off, there was a stitch the outer side of the boot where the shaft and the foot part meet, that some of the fur is stick up, the other boot isn't like that though, it's got the additional stitch needed. Now if these had fit like they should have, I would have just added the additional stitches my self. For the price and the feel of he boot, I really do like them a lot, and when my replacement pair gets here, I plan on wearing them a lot. :-) I give 5 stars to Amazon customer service because they were awesome when I called, because I knew I needed to order a size up. They were very easy to work with and very understanding. So my suggestion is if your foot is usually a half size in boots, you should consider going up to the next size in these. I didn't at first cause I was nervous that they would be too big. However after looking at the size of the boots that I received today, I know that they run smaller than the size they say.",

Everything about them is absolutely perfect. I got the ones in chocolate brown and the color is a nice, dark buff. The laces are cord-style, but not stiff in any way and very easy to tie and adjust. I won't be using them much, though, because the zippers down the inside are more than adequate for getting me into and out of the boot. I'm considering replacing them with lace, because \"combat boot\" is only the style, not the attitude. These would look *adorable* with white lace laces. As for the pockets, the zippers only go about halfway down, but the pocket only goes that far, so it isn't a functional issue. A perk of that same function, however, is that above the ankle the boot is wide and supple, allowing both for a good range of movement while wearing the boot and a pocket deep enough to hold cards, cash, and even a key or two. Another thing I love about these boots is that they're substantial, but they don't make my feet look big. I'm a tall woman, and I have relatively large feet. The narrow sole, blunted toe, and wide ankle give the boots all the \"boot-itude\" a combat boot should have without exaggerating the size of my actual foot. These boots are functional, comfortable, and they make my feet look cute. That's as close to \"life-changing\" as a pair of shoes gets. :-) 10/10 would buy again",

They fit comfortably from the get-go, but if you add some insoles, they become basically the best boots ever. The wee pockets are perfect for those days I don't want to carry a purse and just need a few small things. I've received so many compliments from much more fashionable friends over these boots, and they seem to go with just about everything. Attached picture pairs them with my Wild Bangarang ranger leggings, and the whole look was a perfect casual renn faire outfit. The only real negative I found was that the little buckle prong tips are a little sharp, and will snag on some leggings (and possibly make tiny holes if you aren't careful). I'm going to try filing them down a bit on my next pair to avoid this, but it's just something to watch out for! My first pair of these boots lasted about a year and a half with regular wear. I'm replacing them because one of them finally started to separate from the sole a bit. It's possible I could repair it, but the price is reasonable enough that I feel comfortable just buying a new pair outright. I'll likely be buying a few colors in the coming months, too!",

They were very squeaky at first, but I rubbed the backs and underneath the bucked with a tiny bit of coconut oil and now they're super quiet. I normally wear 8-9 size, bought 8.5 and they fit perfect. There's even room for thick socks. They end right below my calf and look just like the pictures show. They have a hard rubber sole with good tread. They're comfortable enough to wear, but I'm debating buying comfort in-soles just because I plan on hiking around New York for a week in them. The stitching appears to be stable, but I do wonder how long it will last. There's a couple threads sticking out, but they're barely a millimeter long. The laces aren't bad quality. The buckles in the back are just for show, they don't have any other holes for tightening or loosening; one could poke holes easy enough if they needed to. The pockets were a little hard to unzip at first and don't go all the way down (there's about an inch left at bottom) but after being used a couple times they work smoothly. They have plenty of room for a debit card and drivers license. The toes and heels are hard but do bend if stepped on with enough weight.",

The color of these boots are beautiful and look more than they are worth and the gold buckles and zipper is the cherry on top. These may not fit well for people with big calves, it was a close fit for me as I have semi big calves. Maybe without jeans they'd fit easier but they look so stylish with jeans. It has padding inside around the leg so it'll certainly keep you warm in the winter. At first they were tight like most shoes and can rub the pinky toe raw without socks but if you use a shoe stretcher or just wear them they will break in nicely. I recommend using thick socks until then. There is no padding for the feet and no arch support which is kinda bad but adding in your own arch support would make these the best boots. There is some wiggle room for toes but try ordering a size or half up if you have wide feet might be best. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who asked me. They are so nice and cheap so you don't have to waste 100$+ for nice Autumn boots.",

                "review_text": "ORIGINAL REVIEW: I just received these boots today and like any good amazon purchaser I ripped open the box and instantly put them all. Now I expected them to fit a little small (call me crazy but I'm little so I think things look better on me if they are a little smaller than bigger) so when I say they fit as expected, yes they are a little small. I normally wear a size 6 in all shoes and these kind of rub my big toe at the tip. If there are half sizes I would have bought that but I was scared a 7 would be to big. The struggle. But with that being said they are spacious on the sides width wise (again for my little feet) so no rubbing on the sides. Now onto the good stuff. These boots are awesome! I'm super impressive with the whole thing. The texture is great and they feel thick which is awesome because less flimsy parts up top. There is bend at the bottom but that's ok. My calves are the hardest things in most boots. Sense I'm small they are always SO BIG around the top half. Every boot usually looks like rain boots on me. These fit great! I can fit my figures in the top but not a huge gap. So if you have bigger calves it will probably be pretty snug. All in all I'll be ordering more. UPDATED: so sense I last reviewed these boots I bought 2 more. one Taupe and one black. I went ahead and ordered them in a 6 1/2 sense they had it in these colors. I have a little more room in the toes area than in the tan boots I ordered in the 6. The black boots seem to be slightly larger than the Taupe, but they are both size 6 1/2. Either way I still love them and wear all 3! It's like having a snug pair (tan size 6) a \"perfect fit\" (Taupe size 6 1/2) and a loose pair (black 6 1/2) but when looking at all of them you can't tell any size difference! All in all I still love these boots and still recommend them!",

It\u2019s hard to detail exactly what happened here, but I\u2019ll try...upon opening the box, I was greeted with a musty foot funk that should\u2019ve caused me to burn the package in my backyard. Instead of taping the box back up and calling the Department of Homeland Security to report a suspicious package, I further investigated and overflowed my nightmare fuel tank in the process. The shoes in the box were neither the model or color I ordered, but that was the least of my issues. This particular pair looks like they\u2019ve been through a war. The heel sole is completely worn through the rubber, like it\u2019s been gnawed off by thousands of hungry mountain leeches. The metallic buckles are rusted green as if they\u2019ve been tied to a ocean buoy and battered by salty waves for decades. The leather has been distressed like the face of that lady who spent half of her yearly income to put a tanning bed in her kitchen. And the smell? Pickled eggs in the rotted pantry of a forgotten Cold War bunker. I can\u2019t get that stink out of my front room. The vendor that I purchased these from, Fashion Unique, has some explaining to do. Specifically, why they sent me the well-loved boots of a veteran hobo. Please make this right!",

I threw on some black leggings & tried them on & oh my gosh I just love them so much! They look beautiful . They don't look bulky at all ! They're true to size .. actually a little snug but I figure they'll be perfect for cold weather & big cozy socks.

                "review_text": "These shoes are very comfortable and look great. Some of the qualities I'd like to make clear are: 1. These boots fit exactly to size. I'm a size 5 and reading some of the reviews, which mentioned that these run small, I got these shoes a size large and unfortunately found them to be a size bigger when worn. But because I did not want to go into the hassle of returning and waiting for the correct size (which would've taken a week or two and also because I needed warm boots due to the weather) I kept the Sperry's and ordered a pair of thick sheepskin insoles which thankfully did the trick. They wear perfectly now. 2. These are not meant to be winter boots! That is for deep winter climate like below 30 degrees Fahrenheit. They are insulated with a micro fleece, which makes them warm but your feet will not be complete warm if the weather is under 30 degrees. I live in NY where we're going through a cold spell these days, and without my cozy fleece foot liners my feet would've been cold. If you want real cold weather boots go with Sorel's winter boot line or something equivalent. 3. These boots are a little heavier than I'd thought they would be, not uncomfortably so, though. But definitely not light! 4. Yes, they're water proof and I assume snow proof but these do not have a firm grip on ice, as I have noticed they don't have traction on slippery surfaces (like ice or a shiny wet surface) even though they do have good traction on dry and uneven surfaces. 4. Very good quality shoe, well made and if you are like me, who keeps things well- then these will last an extremely long time which I'm looking forward to. 5. Overall very attractive, good quality, waterproof shoe for autumn, cold rain and mild winter but NOT for very cold weather and the sheepskin insert helps in making it a much warmer shoe. 6. I would've definitely preferred to buy it half a size or even a size smaller. FITS TRUE TO SIZE. I have slender, size 5 feet, but if I had flat or wide size 5 feet then the size 6 would've been perfect. I imagine this sizing will help those figuring out the right sizing for their feet in the future. Over all satisfied.",

The tongue on the left shoe is sewn off center so it leans a little to the right. The left shoe is smaller than the right. My left foot is my smaller foot and I could barely get it in the boot. After wearing these around the house a few minutes, they're pretty comfortable and look cute. However, its extremely misleading, along with ILLEGAL, for Amazon to sell counterfeit boots. I saw another reviewer say that they weren't actually waterproof, but I'm too scared to try for fear I won't be able to return, since it was like pulling teeth to return the last pair I ordered in my normal size that were way too small.",

If it were a zip-up boot, I think I would have been fine, but because it was pull-on it's too tight. That was my other gripe, I didn't realize it was a pull-on boot. There is a small zipper on the inside of the ankle that's maybe 6\", but the long zipper that you see in the photos is not a working zipper, so you have to pull on the boot. I'm not sure what compels people to make boots with small zippers at the ankles that go halfway up... just make it a full pull on boot, that zipper isn't doing anyone any favors!",

This photo does this boot NO JUSTICE!! It looks and feels a lot more expensive than it is. I was pleasantly surprised & the exterior texture is not the faux leather look it appears to be. It's actually soft to the touch almost velvety but it's not and hard to explain. My first reaction was, \"woah,\" followed by me feeling up the boot ever so gently as if it was fragile lol. Now for the fit...I always have a hard time finding boots and was prepared to squeeze my calves in as soon as the zipper was approaching the top. To my surprise, I had no issues whatsoever and they went right up with NO struggle. Whoever thought to design a v-shape opening in the back of the boot is a pure genius! I believe this is why the boots fit without a problem. Oh, almost forgot!!! In the pic, the bottoms appear to be the slippery wood finish but NOOOO it's not!!! It's a rubber material ladies so no slipping!!!! The heel is like any other but the rest is rubber so yaaay!!! Don't be hesitant! Order these a 1/2 size larger and you'll be pleased!",

It turned out great, have plenty of room to tuck pants in and even wear thick socks when it is colder out. They are nicely made, very comfortable. I usually have problems with the part on the instep, most times too tight and have to stretch them out, but not this pair. Just luv the style. In fact the day I got them went back to order another pair in a different color. Wish I would had waited just a few days to order because the price dropped and could had saved some money, but hey, I did on the second pair.",

I loved them so much, two days later I bought the same pair in brown! I am wearing them now!! For reference, the circumference of my calves at 14\" around, and these are perfect.

Due to the shape of the footbed and toe I recommend going up a half size. These boots are so stylish and sexy. They look great with jeans or dresses. Very versatile to dress up or down. I now want to order the other two colors. Just waiting for my size to be back in stock. The height of the heel is perfect. Not too tall or short. Comfortable to wear all day. I ordered the taupe and feel it is a versatile color. I can bring out more brown, tan or grey in them depending on the colors I wear with them.",

She is also over 6ft and the height was perfect mid calf, so if you are shorter they may come up higher than you wanted.

This time I overlooked a few of the things that previous reviewers mentioned, so I just wanted to highlight those for everyone else looking. The first is that these boots definitely run narrow at the toe. I ordered a half size up (like others suggested) and they fit... but a full size up might have made them more comfortable. The fact that the toe is slightly pointed might cause this (which is not very visible in the pictures). If you have even slightly wide feet I wouldn't recommend these. The second is that the calf runs small compared to other similar boots (14.5 inches here vs. 15 inches on others). This is clearly stated in the description, but it's worth a mention. If the wide calf option (16.5 inches in the description) was available I would have definitely ordered those. Overall, however, these look like very well made and stylish boots. If you have narrow feet and slender calves, and like a pointed toe, these might be perfect for you! [Details for photos: I'm 6' tall, so these fall about 4\" below my knee. Also, my calves measure 15\" (and a bit bigger in jeans), but these boots stretch slightly for a snug fit. Additional photo to show the pointed toe.]",

A little loud on hard floors, but not as bad as many I've owned before. Calves are a little bigger than I need, but it makes it easy to fit skinny jeans into them. Or just leggings.

They should have sent me new boots. Returning and reordering in hopes of getting new boots this time. Hopefully it was just a fluke. Since I had them here, I tried them on. A few reviewers suggested going up a half size, so I got a 7 and it fit perfectly (I normally wear a 6 1/2, sometimes wide). I have thicker calves, so the boot was a little snug, but it wasn't uncomfortable at all. They're actually pretty nice boots for the price. Had I recieved new boots I would have been really happy with them and gladly given 5 stars. These boots are an amazing deal.

Because the sole is thicker, the boots have a bit more weight than sneakers or pumps, but that is hardly a concern. :)",

Because the packaging was terrible the boots were basically ruined. They were indented and bent and I couldn't get them back to the original shape. This is the first time I have ever experienced bad packaging through amazing. 2. They run small. I'm a true size 11, my whole life I've never had to go up or down a size in a shoe no matter what the brand. This to me fits more like a 10. If you want these I would consider ordering a size up. If the packaging was better and they would have actually fit then I do believe these boots would have been 4-5 stars. Super cute true to color and very warm.",

The black material is also not what I expected. It feels a little like cardboard. These shoes are not worth the price being charged. If I would have had the chance to try them on in a store, I would not have bought them. The biggest improvement that can be made is the shipment. I would have been less disappointed if they were shipped in a box. This would have made the conditions of the shoes better because they would not have had creases all over them. Also, I ordered a 7.5, but these feel more like a 7, would recommend going half of a size bigger. For fit, they also feel and look a little wide around the top of the feet by the toes. This may be different for others, but my feet are normal for width. On a positive note, if creases do not bother you, the fur on the inside was in nice condition and soft. I will not be returning these because of the fact that I do not want to go through the hassle or spend the money for it, but I would not recommend to anyone. Hopefully if you do buy these, they come in better condition than what I got. Best of luck.",

When I initially put them on, they felt a bit tight across the top of my foot. However, after wearing them for an entire day, I can say that they didn't hurt my feet at all (which is big deal, because I deal with foot pain almost daily and in most other pairs of shoes). They were actually quite comfortable. They look really nice and stylish too. As for quality, I'll give it some time to see how they hold up to frequent wear over time. At this price, I may very well get a few more colors. UPDATE: So I've been wearing these booties now for 3 months on an almost daily basis. I must say, they are holding up extremely well. I have so-called comfort shoes in my closet that I can't wear because they cause blisters. On the other hand, these booties are fantastically comfortable! They slip on and off quite easily, even with socks, and I can wear them all day and night and my feet don't hurt at the end of the day. I thought they were cheap shoes because of the price, but they have proven to be an excellent purchase. I am going to order another pair. This pair I have still looks like new, despite frequent wear over 3 months. I never heard of this company before these shoes, but I'll be ordering from them again! Oh, I also want to point out that no one has paid me for my review; it is based on my own experience with the product. I have somewhat wide feet and ankles that frequently swell, and the regular 7 fits me perfectly, where in other shoes, I might feel a bit squeezed.",

I wear between a size 9 - 9.5 so I sized up and got a 10 and although they\u2019re a bit large, I\u2019d rather that than too small. For being a budget friendly brand, these booties are fairly comfortable. By no means are they Vince Camuto\u2019s, but in lieu of the $150 price tag, I will gladly accept these! I recognized the Soda brand but it wasn\u2019t something that stood out to me until I went into my closet and noticed a good 1/3 of my shoes are by Soda! I apparently love this brand! Try these shoes out, you\u2019ll be impressed with the price point quality.",

For example, the \u201cstacked heel\u201d is printed on, but unless you are looking closely it\u2019s hard to tell. Cut outs are clean and clear and give a fun detail that really makes the boot stand out. Super roomy and comfy inside. I am taking a star away as the sole isn\u2019t padded and I will be buying an insole since I am used to more padding. If you aren\u2019t used to super padded shoes (I.e. Sam Edelman\u2019s or Fit Flops) you probably will find these to be very comfy out of the box! Overall super happy with a solid boot.

Probably would not have purchased if I had been able to try them on in a store first, but I make them work and they really are cute with both dresses and skinny jeans.",

Can be worn with a pair of jeans or dressed up with slacks easily. They have a classic shape. Very much like a dress shoe but are every bit a motorcycle boot. I ordered the charcoal but like others have said, they are a muted olive matte with gradual shine at the toes. Which is exactly what drew me to them in the first place. Right out of the box they fit like a glove. Perfect size as I wear a US 10. I can tell they\u2019ll wear in beautifully. The soles are a perfect nub, not too high, not at all low. Feel good and grip positive. Look great at all angles. Gonna take them out for a spin right now on the bike but they are so perfect I almost don\u2019t want to wear in the toe at the shift lol \ud83d\ude09 Highly recommended!",

These boots are true to size, so I bought a size 7.5 (I am either 7.5 or 8 in women's shoes, depending on the brand) and they fit me perfectly, even with my wide feet and with thick fluffy socks on. I like that these are adjustable and fit my enormous calves just fine - plus, you only need to adjust the laces once. After that, you just use the zipper to take them on and off. I bought the grey boots and they look wonderful. They actually look WAY better in person. The grey material is darker and the yellow leather is actually a tan (I saw other customer photos before purchasing so I knew what to expect). I can't wait for it to snow so that I can wear these outside! --------------------- UPDATE --------------------- Well, it finally snowed and I was able to take these boots out for a spin. My husband quickly noticed that I was \"walking funny\" and asked if I was okay. I had also noticed that my right ankle had started to ache. We turned around and went home and I took the boots off and inspected them more closely - turns out, the heel on the right boot isn't level! I'm attaching a photo so you can see how crooked it is. Unfortunately, I was a few days past my last day to return these boots and now I'm stuck with them. After seeing all the great reviews, I'm certain these were a one-off mistake, but I'm still bummed I spent money on faulty boots that I cannot return or exchange.",

Wow I'm surprised how adorable they truly are! I got the gray/white6 I was able to get these $15. Yes worth it! Even at $30 I say yes! I was unsure about the colors but nope they're great. Cons: The bottom (the part that covers the top of foot/toes) is sort like targets winter boots. It's not a hard rubber. Feels like a fake leather. I could push my finger nail into it and it would show. My target boots didn't last 2 years and started cracking. I don't know if these will do that. I hope not for the price I think their worth finding out. Not sure about deep snow with having the side zipper. Also doubt these are truly waterproof. I'll see what my mom thinks but think I'm ordering a pair for myself. These boots are I can see being good for shoveling snow, walking to school in winter, shopping, looking cute in winter. A few weeks ago I ordered the Columbia ice maiden II. In 9 \u00bd... When I put those boots on\u2026 I feel like I'm putting something on that works good but I find really unattractive.

They fit perfectly with a little wiggle room for my toes or some warm socks. 1 plus is that you can change the height of the boot from mid calf to almost knee length. For me I prefer the knee length. 2 negatives are that the sole of the boot is a dark turquoise color and I would prefer it to be one of the boot colors. The other negetive is that when I where it knee height the lace hoops stop at the mid calf height. And so the top flares out a little. So what I did is wrap the rest of the boot lace around my leg for more of a tighter fit. I ordered the grey and tan. The colors are exactly as pictured on Amazon and people's personal pics. All and all pretty good boot for the price. I will give update after wearing them in the Snow and slush.",

Water resistance: I was hoping to find boots that were somewhat weather tough. These fit the bill. The tread is enough to walk on snow and even give some traction on ice. The other day it was pouring and I walked through melting snow but ended the day with dry feet. Comfort: I wore these for an entire week, walking around 4 miles a day and my feet were comfortable and warm the whole time.

However, these are actually INCREDIBLY comfortable, seem pretty sturdily made especially considering the price, and after a few cautious tries-on around the house I decided these felt like they bore my weight well enough to trust wearing for a day of a few small errands. I walked almost a mile and a half in these today, wearing them as they come, without the medical orthotics I've been prescribed for my messed up arches, and yet these felt really great to walk in, enough so that I didn't even notice that it added up to as much as it did. I also have incredibly sensitive tops of my feet, and I don't even have any soreness there after wearing these, which is very hard for me to find in a stiff and cozy-fit shoe like this, that isn't a padded skate shoe. I also got a compliment on them from a stranger (plus two from my own family if you count that), the very first day wearing them out! The inside lining is a fleece-y type fabric very similar to fleece-lined leggings, that is a bit much for me in anything over about 65 degrees, but I personally am very prone to overheating; they would probably be just about perfect for anyone who likes or needs a bit more warmth to their feet and lower part of the legs, or just as a good dry-cold weather shoe. I live in the PNW though so I will be giving these a good waterproofing spray treatment before wearing them out in wet weather, just to be safe. They do feel sturdy, but if you've found a $20 shoe that can truly withstand an accidental trod through a curb-depth puddle, you've slipped into an alternate dimension, and I don't want to use these to test which I might be in! I also want to emphasize that these are a very cozy fit. I did have the laces tied snug but the foot part itself was just perfect, not loose at all but I also never had any issues feeling cramped or pinched in them or having any spots that rubbed wrong, which anyone who shares my size or flat arches will know, is remarkably difficult especially in an 11. The fuzzy lining probably helps. Overall, the phrase \"fits like a glove\" couldn't be more accurate. To anyone who is looking to these for cosplay, I officially say go for it. I will most definitely be coming back for the brown ones in this same tall style for Katniss, as they are a PERFECT fit for hers, and when the short style is back in stock in my size, those in black for a slightly modified Chloe Price, too.",

I am a bigger girl, so this was somewhat expected (which is why I am still giving this five stars). I was going to return them but I have found a way to make it work for me.

They seem pretty sturdy and well made. My expectations are very realistic and not high at this price range. So if I can get two seasons wear out of these before they\u2019re warm out, I won\u2019t be mad at that and might even reorder. If I can three seasons out of these I\u2019ll be quite pleased. Any more than that, I will be extremely impressed. I likely won\u2019t be using the little hidden pouch, but I like the idea of it. There is definitely enough room in there to fit a credit card. (Yes, I tested it out). So yeah, it\u2019s a generous little hiding space if you need it. Anyway, I\u2019ve only been wearing these a couple of days but they are SO comfortable and SO warm!

One problem that I had was that in only one of my shoes, it was a very tight fit. I am a dead-on size 10, and because I have fairly narrow feet and average calves, I thought that would be able to get away with a size 10 instead of an 11. I might be able to get away with 1-2 hours in these shoes before I get pain and numbness in my toes and arch. There is also very little padding in the bottom liner and you can feel the hard base of the shoe with every step. I think that if I had sized up, most of these problems wouldn't be so bad or might be solved with added insoles. The \"tightness\" of the shoe through the foot and calf area was fine, it was just the toe area that seemed to stop a bit short. It was just strange that one of my shoes was tighter in the toe area than the other shoe.",

They come in a sturdy box (complete with a fabric handle for easy carry) and they were wrapped in a thin mesh to prevent scuffs during transport. The box was a little too small for these boots, so they were folded over at the top. There are no permanent creases as far as I can tell, though. In terms of sizing and comfort, they're great! I wear a 8.5 or a 9 in most shoes, and the 8.5 pair I ordered fits great with a little wiggle room in case I want to double up on socks for cold weather. They are snug around my calves, as well, and they don't \"flop\" around my leg like the reviews have said on these and other combat-style boots. (I'm 5'5\" and 145 lbs, for the sake of reference. If you have very skinny or very large ankles and calves, these boots may not be for you.) The one thing that majorly peeved me about these boots is the secret pocket. I know other reviews complained about its size, but I didn't realize that the pocket size didn't actually extend the full length of the zipper. If you look at the pictures I'll include, you'll see the zipper doesn't go all the way down; the place where it stops marks the final length of the pocket. As for pocket depth, it's fine. You could fit a few credit cards and some bills in there for emergencies, but it's hard to zip up and down; I wouldn't want to struggle with the zipper on a secret credit card pocket for too long in public, so I don't know how much I'll use it. Overall, they're a fine pair of boots, but the selling point for me of having a secret pocket didn't turn out to really be worth it. You can mostly likely find other combat boots for a similar or lower price that are built just as well.",

I am a true size 6 and ordered a 6.5 so I could wear thick socks with them. They are a little big and I might have been able to get away with a 6 and still wear thicker socks, but I wasn\u2019t risking that. That being said, they\u2019re true to size and comfortable. They could use a little more support, but I wear them for long periods of time. I like pocket design and it does only zip halfway, which isn\u2019t a drawback for me. I really do like these, however, there\u2019s some major flaws that need pointed out. First, the inner lining is not a faux fur as advertised. If you see in my photos, it\u2019s more of a fleece like what most leggings are lined with, but not as soft as leggings. On a positive, they are still very warm. Second, there\u2019s glue seeping out of the bottom sole where the stitching is in certain areas in photo 4. The last thing, on one of my boots there is a slight discoloration of a white mark as shown in my last photo. I am stuck between 3 and 4 stars because they\u2019re cute, a good price and I wear them a lot. I had to go with 3 stars because I wasn\u2019t expecting these flaws. Even at the good price point, I\u2019ve bought better quality boots at the same price at TJ Maxx and Burlington. I don\u2019t regret this purchase because the rest of the boot seems well made and I actually want to check out their other boots with the fur linings. Not sure if I got the lemon of the bunch, but they\u2019re a $20 boot max.",

The good news is I absolutely adore the boots. They're gorgeous, the bottom looks like it would be quite useful with traction, the side pockets are amazing. The bad news is because I ordered a size up (size 11) I can pull my entire foot out of the boot without unlacing or unzipping the boot. But of course by the time I figured this out, the grey colour had sold out in my size and I'm stuck buying these brown ones for my trip. I recommend highly that you purchase your normal size, even with the lining, the boot will fit.",

I knew they would be nicer than the cheapest boot out there but also not superb. I think that these are better investment than bearpaws because they seem to be made just as well and will probably last just as long. Only complaint I have about these and reason for not giving five stars is that the left is slightly shorter on the inside of the boot. It's hardly noticeable though so I'm perfectly happy with them. The souls are durable enough for outside use. Cute enough to wear out with the right clothes and also could be used for inside lounging. Either way nice Boot and I'm very happy.",

                "review_text": "After getting frustrated with the expensiveness and poor fit of UGGS, I decided to try these boots. I'm glad I did because I like them much better than UGGS...the quality of the sheepskin is just as good (and even though the description says that these are suede lined with sheepskin, they are sheepskin, with a little patch of suede on the heel) and the styling and fit is better. It is great to have a zipper in the back for people like me with a high instep/ high arches, and the shaft of the boot and the area around the ankle and top of the foot is narrow enough so that the boots don't move around too much when you walk. The footpad is a nice thick sheepskin, providing comfort and cushioning. Regarding sizing: I am almost always a size 9, but since some reviews said that these run a little large and since I just had to return a pair of UGGS in a size 9 because they were too loose, I decided to try an 8. Although they fit snugly and my toe goes to the end of the boot, they are comfortably snug and I can walk in them without them flopping around. Because of my high instep and the fact that the zipper does not go down to the bottom of the boot, they do not slip on easily, but rather I have to work them on carefully so as not to break the zipper (which is sturdy, fortunately), but I imagine that they will stretch out a bit over time. Even though my toe is at the end of the boot, because the sheepskin is so soft, they are not uncomfortable...I have used orthotic footpad inserts in similar boots in the past, but so far I don't need them in these due to the nice cushioning of the sheepskin footpad. So, I'm not sure if these really run big (I notice that the European sizing is 38 for a size 8, rather than the usual 39--but they are the same length as my Haflinger clogs in a size 39), but I would say that if you are a half size regularly, you should probably size down. If you are a full size, you could size down a full size (as I did), but only if you want them to fit snugly. If you have high arches (like me), know that you may find it a little hard to get them on, even with the zipper, especially if you size down. All in all, I love the boots--they are comfortable, well made, and half the price of the UGGS.",

I'm on SSI and simply cannot afford the other brand of boots that I've needed to wear due to numerous foot surgeries.

My toe is very close to toe of the boot and the shoes do feel a little tight in the front area. Everywhere else (the heel, calf, etc.) feels just fine. Luckily, I'm not planning on wearing them for a long period of time anyway, I'm using them for a cosplay, so they won't be on my feet for long before I change. However, if your boots are a tad small like mine and there isn't a bigger size available atm, my tip is to loosen the laces. I untied the boots and retied them a bit looser than when they first came in and my feet feel wonderful now. I'll also be wearing them around the house for a bit in hopes of stretching them out and breaking them in. All in all, I'm very satisfied and happy with my purchase.

The brown wasn't a true brown, it was more of a chocolate brown and in the wrong light, it looked more black than brown. I like the style of these and the ankle is not huge..alot of boots swallow my ankles. I wear size 8& that is what size I have in the Tan..pefect fit. I wear normal width and these boots are great. Below is a pic for those of you to see the difference in the shades..ignore my socks. I love when people give detailed reviews and tell me what color product they ordered so I thought I would do so. On my right foot is the Tan, on my left is the Brown. I kept the Tan as I felt it was a good shade for my wardrobe. I hope this helps.",

They are of average comfort - about what you'd expect for a boot with a heel. I can wear these for a few hours without complaint. And have I mentioned they're adorable? :) I'm usually leery of things with buckles, but these don't look cheesy and don't have that cheap look I hate. I ordered brown so it goes with almost every outfit I own, which is very convenient. Cons: No real cons I can find. They're a decent price, fit nice, wear well. If I could tell the manufacturer anything, it'd be to add some padding on the heel so I could wear them all day long, but that's what store bought insoles are for. ;)",

I can't ever find boots in my size or they're too slender and I can't get my foot inside. These boots are awesome. They're definitely not a fast slip on boot and go. The side zipper only goes up half the boot, so they'll need untied and tied for putting on and taking off. Some of the other reviews stated that they're slightly larger in size, and they are. But, that's a good thing... Thick socks can be worn without pinching toes. I have huge calves and they fit with no problem. I have small ankles, so the boots are pretty big in that area, Again not a big deal... Just room for thick socks. I'm 5'10\" with fairly long legs (although most of my height is from my torso), and when the boots are unfolded, they come all the way up to the bottom of my knee. The faux fir doesn't run the entire length, but there is a fuzzy soft lining inside and it'll easily keep your feet and legs warm. The box they arrived in, is a perfect square and now that they're out, there's no way I can get them back in. I was surprised it was the boots when I saw the box size. Other than that, I'm very pleased with this purchase, and can't wait to wear them out. I'm gonna have to buy more outfits to wear with them \ud83d\ude03",

I was just wearing normal weight socks yet my feet were never cold, but they were never hot either. A perfect temperature. I stepped directly in huge puddles and never even got slightly damp. I HIGHLY recommend these boots. I have flat feet, so my feet ache pretty easily normally. Not one single time did my feet hurt or did anything rub despite my thin socks in these boots. I added a very thin memory foam insert before I ever even wore them because of my flat feet, but it was nothing serious and I still think even without them I would have been very comfortable.

                "review_text": "I'm writing this review only hours after I got these boots, and I am SO excited to try them out outside in the cold weather! I'm in Madison, Wisconsin, and this week is going to stay in the 30's and even dip into the 20's (Fahrenheit!). I will update this review accordingly, and come back in a couple months to write details on durability when it comes to some real winter weather (hello blizzards and -20 degrees!!). The first thing I noticed out of the box is that they don't have any weird smells, which is great. The outside smell faintly of leather, because that's what they're made of. I looked up the company, and Bearpaw's boots are outside = leather, inside = sheepskin. So if you're thinking about using these in snow like me, we need to waterproof these babies! Luckily I have a spray already to use on them. The inside of these boots is SO SOFT. If I wore these barefoot (which you can, apparently, but for me - ew! I get sweaty feet), my feet would be in heaven. I tried wearing them with bare legs to see how soft it felt (because against your hands it doesn't feel that soft, it's got kind of a soft, but wooly feel to it) and against my legs it felt so fluffy and silky, so airy!! And warm!! None of the color (I ordered Chocolate) has transferred to my socks/pants. Awesome! Also, from ALL the pictures I browsed through on the internet, none of them had any good views of the inner lining. I really wanted to judge how thick it was before I ordered, but since I couldn't find any good pictures, I just trusted the reviews saying that they're warm enough for really, really cold winters. And the lining is decently thick - I'd say it's about an inch thick, although over time it might get compressed a little with constant wear. The soles are a different color wool than the rest (it's white instead of chocolate), but still soft and fluffy. It feels like I'm walking on down pillows, mmmm! I put up several pictures of my boots if anyone is interested - of all angles, including the lining! Here is a link to my video of the boot: [...] Some of the reviews said that after a month or two the lining starts wearing off and comes off on your clothes... The lining looks pretty well made, so I don't know if that will happen, but I will update this review if it does start coming off. Hopefully not... I am really loving these! The bottom of the boots is made of really nice, sturdy but flexible rubber and I can see this really holding up for Wisconsin winters! So excited!! It's as thick as my other winter boots, so that's great news. SIZE: I read so many reviews about what size to order, and it just got confusing. There were pretty much equal amounts of reviews telling you to order down a size, or order up a size. So I went to the Bearpaw website and they suggested ordering up a size... I usually wear a 9.5 exact (no size 9, no size 10), so I decided to order a size 10. It makes sense, because there's a layer of fluff that you have to consider when you think about how much space there is for your feet. The size 10 fits me really well. When I first put them on, they seemed a tad bit small, but after walking around in them for a few hours, they're already form-fitting to my feet. Basically: when you order, think about what your size would be when considering an extra inch of lining around your feet, and also remember that you don't want to order too large, because they do form around your feet after some use (that lining will be squished by your walking!). If you're a half size, order the next whole size like I did. I can't speak for people who have whole sizes because I didn't have that situation, but hopefully a size up won't be too big! On an interesting side note, I think I remember that the Bearpaw website says you can wear these in any kind of weather - and I think that's just weird? How could you wear these on a hot summer day?? These are real winter boots and your feet would hate you for that, hah! **** UPDATE ************************ UPDATE ************************* UPDATE ****************************************** January 2, 2014 So good news everyone! Turns out that the fur lining does NOT rub off on your clothes/socks. I think it kind of did like the second or third day I wore it (probably because it was getting broken in), but it wasn't even that much, and after that it has NEVER happened again. The color never has rubbed off on anything, even in the beginning. So at this point I would DEFINITELY recommend that you DO NOT buy a size up if you can get your exact size. Only order a little up if you have a half size, just because they don't sell half sizes. After breaking them in they really form fit to your feet, so don't freak out if they feel a little tight when you first get them (it's just that the lining hasn't been squished by your feet yet - think of it like getting super fluffy slippers that mold to your feet). The boot itself is holding up phenomenal, it's so worth the money! The rubber sole looks barely touched or scuffed or worn down at all and I've been wearing them daily since I got these (so mid-November til beginning of January at this point). I used them to walk to class every day (a mile or two) and I have been running and tramping through half a foot of snow with them. Waterproofing them helps them keep dry and also miraculously keeps all traces of salt stains off - they literally look like I just got them like last week, it's amazing. As for the stitching on the sides - before I bought them I read some reviews saying that the thread has come apart on the stitching on the outside. So far for me, the stitching has been doing really great - I think there were a couple tiny fly aways at first but it's inconsequential to the strength of the stitches (holding up real well) and no more are occurring over time. So finally the weather has been getting really cold here (this week we are getting -45 degrees Fahrenheit with the windchill factor and several inches of snow), and I never leave the house without these boots! Actually if I wear them inside the house my feet get too warm. These keep me warm no matter what I'm doing (hiking, walking on frozen lakes, walking through snow and wind). Because of these boots, I actually don't care about the weather outside anymore! I never worry about my toes getting cold, which was a HUGE problem with some of my other boots I've had over the years, because even though the boots were thick and sturdy on the outside (hard rubber or leather), they just didn't keep my toes warm. These are life savers for a Wisconsin girl in Winter!! I don't care about people who say they would never buy them because they look like uggs - I bought these for warmth and boy do they deliver. I have always gone for comfort when it comes to apparel and this is going to be a staple of mine if they don't discontinue these for the next few decades.",

But they have slits for grip on the soles and from standard use, the slits have split all the way into the cushion on the bottom of the boots. There is probably a better tread pattern than this one. Update: I submitted a warranty request through Bearpaw on January 10th, they approved the request on 1/16 and now it is 1/25 and I still have no tracking number like it has shipped yet. It may have shipped and I just don't have it yet. But 2 weeks in Ohio winter with no wearable boots is annoying. I don't buy lots of extra shoes, I just buy what I need so I didn't have a backup expect heavy snow boots. I feel like I should have just bought another pair and wrote these off instead of getting the warranty request.",

I'm a US 7.5 and the 7.5 fit much closer to an 8 or an 8.5 in the foot and is extremely small in the ankle/calve area. The boots do stretch a bit at the thigh after a few wears so it's necessary to readjust the string placement pretty much every time you put them on. The heel is extremely high, which has never been a problem for me in the past especially when it comes to boots, but I ended up stretching one of the ligaments in my foot as a result of wearing these for three days in a row. Overall, the fit is big, the heel is high, and they constantly have to be adjusted.",

They didn't have my usual size in the color needed, so I rounded up to the next size and they fit perfectly - with a little extra room for my toes which is what I always look for. The tops of the boots stayed up all night when loosely tied. They are adjustable via the drawstring, which is made of plastic fake leather. The only thing, in my opinion, that looked cheap about the boots was that drawstring and the finish of the very top, which is just stitched like a clothing seam rather than boot stitching. The \"natural\" color is not an off white as shown, but more of a very light tan. They went really well with ivory leggings & a dark green tunic, although I kept asking my husband if I looked like one of Robin Hood's merry men. :)",

I brought my backup shoes just in case I was imagining things, knowing that it could go downhill real fast with a lot of walking (which is what I do in NYC). True story - I wore them every single day - all day - from morning (walking) to night in all venues (they look that good) and then some. I never used my backup pair - I lived in these shoes every day. What a lovely surprise to get a great pair of boots that kept my feet warm, had room for wool socks, a generous toe box and no heel slippage. We averaged 13K steps every day and never once did my feet feel cold, crowded, or uncomfortable. Plus - my ankles were warm and shielded from the fierce winds. LOVE these BOOTS!",

I wanted to find something that was both durable and stylish that I could wear daily- and these definitely filled both of those roles, and went way above my expectations- especially at this price point. - Solid material and make, clean and color was just as displayed from the seller's images. - Surprisingly soft interior. - Comfortable for my everyday wear and go great with my jeans- dark blues and greys. - They fit really well (bought size 11, i normally wear 10.5 - 11.5- just depends on the make), and I have wide/flat feet. Which was my biggest concern, seeing as some/most shoes end up being more narrow and uncomfortable. I think the only think I would have loved to from these would have been it having a thicker insole for more cushion- but that's personal preference. That being said, I'm definitely using the money I saved buying this vs more expensive mainstream brands to buy a comfy insert and toss it in these bad boys. Overall, I really am happy with my purchase.They arrived quickly, well packaged, and are well made. These are a great bang for your buck sort of boots, especially at that price point. I know for sure I'm going to look over their other products and wishlist another pair of these for a future purchase.",

As such I'm deducting one star 03/08/2018 - update after helping my friend move heavy furniture the sole of on of the boots detached.

Water enters the sole crevices and then seeps into the insole to the feet and then cannot get out because they have a waterproof housing.

Initially she had reservations about trying on the two inch high heels as she couldn't imagine that they would be comfortable or practical. Thankfully, not only do they fit like a dream but they look hot on her! The chunky heel is the key to comfort and stability and the plush upper makes this ankle boot a class act beauty! The velvety material shimmers and looks fantastic with boot cut jeans. I think these trendy boots would work for a wide ranging demographic as they are exceptionally comfortable for a 2\" chunky heel and have an understated class that needs no explanation. This is a gorgeous boot that elongates the legs and provides a slimming effect in the process. They are easy to slip into and zip up. My wife has been pleased with the Fix shoe brand, but the Sutton Round Toe Ankle Boot is an instant favorite. They arrive in a nice box with an optional storage bag enclosed. Very nice packaging! ~ Kort",

The zipper goes all the way down almost to the sole, making them very easy to get on and off. My only complaint is that, while the \"sueded\" versions (such as olive and black-23) fit perfectly, the smooth-finish versions (such as black-24) seemed to run about a half-size too small.

I put an inner sole in for a little support, but without it is like being in bare feet which is okay too. I bought them for a trip where I will be hiking during the day but going to nice dinner places at night and these will be perfect to wear at night to comfort my feet and look good. The weight is also perfect for packing. I'm only giving them a 4 because of the lack of support, and I felt the need to add a supportive inner sole.

For reference, I\u2019m 5\u2019 and 150 lbs. Length is perfect with leggings. Plenty of flare to hide my belly and bottom without like a tent. The sleeves are about 24-25\u201d long. For me, that\u2019s about 1-2\u201d too long but the cuffs keep them in place. Definitely a keeper!",

I ain\u2019t coming back. These are surprisingly fashion-forward: I think it\u2019s the button on the side and fur at the top, but they don\u2019t look as boxy as the original ones. I got black, because it\u2019s the only color I wear, and I haven\u2019t been disappointed at all.

I was initially skeptical about ordering these through Amazon and not Nordstrom because of a potential return and not sure if they are knock-offs. I wish I had got them through Nordstrom. April 14th, she pulled them on and the material ripped open on the side. Are you freaking kidding me!!!!! She\u2019s had at least a dozen pair through the years and never has there ever been this type of problem. Clearly the \u201cuggs\u201d being sold here are of a suspicious quality, or UGG themselves are feeling the economic pinch and going with poor material or craftsmanship, crapping on the consumer like so many other companies. I\u2019m pissed that the return policy through Amazon expired way back in January, and I\u2019m pissed about the disconnect between a manufacturer and Amazon customers. It seems like a company can put inferior products on Amazon and charge the same premium price. I feel like I got double teamed on this purchase by UGG and Amazon both, and my only recourse is to tell my girlfriend \u201coh well\u201d. This is the worst transaction I\u2019ve made on Amazon. I had hoped to give it zero stars but I guess they did last for a couple months so maybe one star is fitting. After checking them out it seemed pretty clear that these were made much more poorly than the other pairs she has. What a disgrace. I\u2019ll add a photo when she gets home later.",

I was pleased to receive them in their lovely original box, packaged in white tissue paper. We'd ordered her the black, size 8. She reports they fit perfectly and were immediately comfortable. The fur inside is nice and soft, perfect for keeping your feet warm. I noticed while she was wearing them that they came up about a quarter way up her shin.

Lastly, for our account purposes we need the itemized invoice for what is being paid for in the current invoice. Currently I have to find the previous months invoice to get the itemized list so I can pay the current month's invoice. So in other words, the amount that is due should also have the itemized invoice in the following pages in addition to the other active charges. I can't pay for an item if I can't code it in our budget and I shouldn't have to flip between different invoices from different months to figure it out. Keep it simple.

I am taking one star off because the shape of the boot doesn't compensate for the fact that there's no zipper, so you have to loosen the laces 3-4 eyelets down to the ankle to get them on, and the laces are those stiff kinda plasticky feeling ones that don't slide through the eyelets at all and don't stay tied. Definitely going to get some fabric or soft leather laces. Other than that they're comfy and the fit is spot on. I was literally just trying them on when a tree fell on our house, I ran outside, and forgot that I was even wearing them. I ended up wearing them for about 4 hours climbing up and down a steep hill hauling branches and logs, and they were totally comfy and supportive the whole time.

These are the second pair of boots I have purchased from this company and I enjoy their shoes a lot. They are inexpensive yet last a fairly long time when taken care of, I also spray mine with water repellent (2-4 years) and being that I'm rough on my shoes, that's really good.

He wants to talk to you about your poem, \"One Day.\" He says, \"you may be funny, and you may know a few things about cats, but let me tell you. You are right that we are not equal, but every feline knows who's really in command, and we don't need to wear the pair of your slacks we just peed on to prove it. And seeing as we can reduce you silly humans to a pile of gibberish with a nonstop flood of puddles or aromatic piles, the people who feed us will *never* be our equals, and we cats know who's really in command here.\" So, Catzilla's comments aside, because yah, he totally wears the Emperor's hat in this house, and should we ever doubt it, he sends his sidekick, Sith Whispicus out to reinforce his demands...this is a funny book, if you've ever had a cat with a touch of the spiteful in him. Cough *Catzilla*. And mostly, I think the author gets it right. I bought this book for my daughter, but I did some reading myself when it came in today because when I had looked at the on-line preview, it made me laugh. And I always like a good laugh. I do have to say though, my favorite cat humor book remains \"A Cat's Night Before Christmas,\" by Beard/Jones/Boswell. It used to leave me gasping for air every time I read it, until it became my daughter's favorite book as a toddler. And we read it over, and over, and over because that's what toddler's do. And being able to quote it from memory allows me to breath when it's read, but I can still smile when thinking about it. So that's a good one to try too, and very on point if you're a cat owner. But otherwise, I thought this one was funny in a more artsy kind of way, and I know my daughter is going to love reading it as well.",

In part this is due to cats' cleverness. They have kept the battles at such a low level, we don't know the war is going on. It rages silently, below our radar. The author of \"I Could Pee on This\" is breaking the news to those who have been ignorant in their bliss. The cats have won. They are in charge. You don't believe it? Well, who's the one cleaning the litter box? Francesco Marciuliano knows cats. From feline typewriter fixation to toilet paper destruction to shattered wineglasses, the man has suffered\u2013\u2013as have we all\u2013\u2013at the paws of cats. And for the love of the diabolical little suckers, he\u2013\u2013as do all we cat captives\u2013\u2013keeps coming back for more. See \"This Is My Chair\" for your Cat's attitude towards property rights, \"Busy, Busy\" for cat sleeping habits. \"I Run\" reveals a cat's intense desire to appear to know what he's doing. \"Tripped\" and \"Talk to Me\" reveal your cat's devious nature and possible criminal intent. In \"Kneal (sic) before Me\" the true nature of Cat/human relations is revealed. \"Nudge\" has been my own personal experience with five cats over 60 years, so that one is absolutely dead-on right. Blush at \"Man's Best Friend\" because it's probably true. \"Family\" is very likely true\u2013\u2013you aren't that important. Every cat is the center of his own universe. You are just a satellite. \"I Lick Your Nose\" is so true that I've bought thicker makeup to cover scratch scars from the cat who repositions me to suit his favored sleeping spots during the night. This is done by digging into my cheek or eye socket and pulling. When accomplished during REM sleep, I don't discover Rowdy's act of violence until I wash my face in the morning. And, of course, the title piece says it all: Your cat will dominate you at every turn. I laughed all the way through \"I Could Pee on This,\" often reading pertinent verses to my husband as we lay in the dark, me reading my Kindle, he drifting off to sleep. He didn't always react as I would have hoped. I'm hoping it was because he was half-asleep. I've converted him to being a cat person. But does the dog person in him still prevail? Rowdy, Jeep, Liam, Smokey and I must get together and work on him. If forty-two years of cat domination haven't quite converted him yet, we'll have to take more drastic action.... KL",

Because it is the first official full-length recording of CATS, this does not always mean that the world-premiere rendition is always the best. The London cast gives a fairly adequate performance of the score, and perform it with a softer-grained approach as compared to their Broadway counterparts. And the lean-textured recording has sounded even better than before with this recent digital remastering. Elaine Paige may be acknowledged as a foremost interpreter of Grizabella, but here her performance shows that she neds some time to get into the spirit of the role. She does give a fine rentition of Memory that, despite competition from Betty Buckley, allows her to hold her own. Brian Blessed gives a firm, commanding and sonorous portrayal of Old Deuteronomy. He has a convicting voice that he demonstrates to great effect in his solos, even in his powerful Ad-Dressing of Cats. The lower-level principals don't seem to fare that well. Wayne Sleep as Mr. Mistoffelees and Paul Nicholas as Rum Tum Tugger cope adequately with the demands of the score, but they don't sing their parts with character and hence sound rather stilted. But nevertheless, most of the supporting cast members make up for these disappointments with crisp choral diction, even if their singing is a little laid back. The minor cats feature Myra Sands as a sprightly and no-nonsense Jennyanydots and Susan Jane Tanner as a soothing Jellylorum. Not to mention Bonnie Langford's lively portrayal of Rumpelteazer, and young Sarah Brightman's sweet, innocent and pure Jemima. Perhaps Jeff Shankley could be weak as Munkastrap here. And Stephen Tate makes a cameo appearance as a somewhat weak-voiced Gus: the Theatre Cat and Growltiger. The cast is ably supported by a firm hand in David Firman's direction of the orchestral accompaniments. It would be worth noting that this version of CATS is interesting in itself as a concept album. This is because the show underwent some extensive revisions for its Broadway premiere before the revisions were incorporated into all CATS productions worldwide. Almost the whole of the T.S. Eliot text is presented in this performance, with less verse cuts than the Broadway recording. In addition, you can also get to savour two draft versions of songs that were re-written. Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer is given a jazzy setting which, in context, sounds a little stilted as compared to the jaunty music-hall setting written for Broadway. But, it is still interesting in itself. And so is the Ballad of Billy M'Caw, included during Growltiger's Last Stand. It may be more restrained than the Italian aria, but it still shows the character that Growltiger could have adopted if this song was retained. Other than these two notable drawing-board versions, the early drafts are minor, but still interesting. On the whole, I find this performance of CATS lacking in some sort of joie de vivre and spirit. Yet, for its historical value, I still recommend it, and makes a good alternative listening experience as compared to the Broadway cast. The packaging in a slimline double-disc jewel case includes a booklet with some production photographs from the London production, a cast list and a poorly-produced libretto in small print. There is also an abridged version of this recording (like the Broadway cast version has) that makes an ideal introduction to this recording in general, and it features the same selections as its Broadway counterpart. As an aside, this recording of CATS is not wholly complete, because it lacks The Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles due to the need to accomodate space on record.",

                "review_text": "I do not mean to ruffle anybody's feathers in my comments of this particular CATS recording, However, of all the official English-language recordings this recording sounds a little stilted and wanting in that littbe bit of energy. Part of it could be due to some of the performances, and part of it because this album uses the first version of CATS. Yet despite the lack of oomph, it is quite good and redeems itself by the aura it projects for being the world-premiere recording of the score. This recording features the Grizabella of Elaine Paige, who can be considered a true Grizabella in her own right. It's true that this early recording doesn't allow her to nuance the role as she did in the video, but she conveys a strength and vulnerability in her portrayal. Paige's rendition of Memory is solid, but at this early stage she had yet to mature into the role. I guess that it's also because this recording used the single version of the song, and that's probably why it sounds stilted. Brian Blessed partners her with his sincere and benevolent portrayal of Old Deuteronomy, and the rest of the performers fare quite well. However, I found Paul Nicholas as The Rum Tum Tugger to be somewhat wanting in energy. He fares a little better in his rendition of Mr. Mistoffelees, but doesn't smoke it out in his standout number. I think this is pretty much the case for most of the performers here, as the performances of the cast as a whole sound solid yet stilted at the same time. The orchestrations are less flashy and somewhat weak but you can hear the sort of sound that Lloyd-Webber originally intended for the musical, and the variants. Yes, this West End cast recording is like a concept album of sorts, staying closer to the T.S. Eliot cat poems without cutting verses as in later productions. The redeeming feature of this West End cast recording are the variants of numbers that were changed in lature productions. One variant, the duet for Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer is set to an unvarying and jazzy melody that Lloyd-Webber replaced with the vaudeville-like version as heard on the Broadway video and in the video. The other variant is the duet for Growltiger and Griddlebone during Growltiger's Last Stand. Before this duet number was replaced with the better-fitting Puccini spoof, Growltiger and Griddlebone sang a rather unromantic drinking song about a musically talented parrot named Billy M'Caw. Even if Lloyd-Webber admits to preferring Billy M'Caw I tend to like the Puccini spoof a little better as it better integrates itself into the scene. For those who are used to the later versions of these numbers and to the beefed-up orchestration of the Broadway and video versions, this recording can offer a nice contrast. Yet in my view they have only made the rewrites and revisions that Lloyd-Webber added to the score for the rest of the productions much better. Despite my feelings, at least the aura of this recording is enough to save it from being stilted, despite the solid performances from everyone concerned. And besides, it includes extra verses that were cut for the Broadway and subsequent productions of the show, so it makes this album feel closer to the T.S. Eliot poems. It's good to see this recording in a reissue that treats it with respect. The 2 CDs come in a slimline double-disc case, packaged in a neat slipcase. The booklets are an improvement over those in the previous Polydor releases, as they have offered a better-print edition of the libretto and the production credits, including the musical numbers. However, I do admit that there isn't much of a difference in sound quality between this release and the original Polydor CD. The CDs appear to have been pressed from the original CD master rather than the better-sounding remastered version that was released in 1998. I know that if I were to recommend this West End cast recording I would recommend the 1998 remastered version, as it sounds less muffled compared to the sound on this release. Yet it would not be practical because that 1998 CD costs a whopping 65 dollars. In short, even if CATS fans covet this recording I'm sorry to say I don't covet it as much as they do. I acknowledge its strengths, but yet I know it sounds a little stilted on the whole. Even so, this recording redeems itself with its solid performance and the aura of it representing the first thoughts of Andrew Lloyd-Webber and staying close to T.S. Eliot's source material before the show was tweaked and altered for Broadway. But my first choice for a CATS recording still lies with the Broadway cast Cats: Complete Original Broadway Cast Recording (1982 Original Broadway Cast) as it's got this energy that makes the show work, without destroying its spirit and nature.",

Because it is the first official full-length recording of CATS, this does not always mean that the world-premiere rendition is always the best.

And the lean-textured recording has sounded even better than before with this recent digital remastering. Elaine Paige may be acknowledged as a foremost interpreter of Grizabella, but here her performance shows that she neds some time to get into the spirit of the role.

Before this duet number was replaced with the better-fitting Puccini spoof, Growltiger and Griddlebone sang a rather unromantic drinking song about a musically talented parrot named Billy M'Caw. Even if Lloyd-Webber admits to preferring Billy M'Caw I tend to like the Puccini spoof a little better as it better integrates itself into the scene. For those who are used to the later versions of these numbers and to the beefed-up orchestration of the Broadway and video versions, this recording can offer a nice contrast. Yet in my view they have only made the rewrites and revisions that Lloyd-Webber added to the score for the rest of the productions much better. Despite my feelings, at least the aura of this recording is enough to save it from being stilted, despite the solid performances from everyone concerned. And besides, it includes extra verses that were cut for the Broadway and subsequent productions of the show, so it makes this album feel closer to the T.S. Eliot poems. It's good to see this recording in a reissue that treats it with respect. The 2 CDs come in a slimline double-disc case, packaged in a neat slipcase. The booklets are an improvement over those in the previous Polydor releases, as they have offered a better-print edition of the libretto and the production credits, including the musical numbers. However, I do admit that there isn't much of a difference in sound quality between this release and the original Polydor CD. The CDs appear to have been pressed from the original CD master rather than the better-sounding remastered version that was released in 1998. I know that if I were to recommend this West End cast recording I would recommend the 1998 remastered version, as it sounds less muffled compared to the sound on this release. Yet it would not be practical because that 1998 CD costs a whopping 65 dollars. In short, even if CATS fans covet this recording I'm sorry to say I don't covet it as much as they do. I acknowledge its strengths, but yet I know it sounds a little stilted on the whole. Even so, this recording redeems itself with its solid performance and the aura of it representing the first thoughts of Andrew Lloyd-Webber and staying close to T.S. Eliot's source material before the show was tweaked and altered for Broadway. But my first choice for a CATS recording still lies with the Broadway cast Cats: Complete Original Broadway Cast Recording (1982 Original Broadway Cast) as it's got this energy that makes the show work, without destroying its spirit and nature.",

So if you let them out, prepare yourself for burial detail because they will bring it home, sometimes still alive, so that you can admire their prowess. Oh, and about the going outside, if they want out you will be in for a real battle of wits and my money is on the Siamese. On the down side, they are thieves we had one who had collected quite a few tennis balls. We didn't figure out where they were coming from until the town paper ran an article about the phantom cat snagging tennis balls in mid flight and taking off with them. I can attest to their protective streak. I had a medical emergency late one night, I did not know I was in trouble but somehow my Siamese did. He unlocked the bedroom door went downstairs and kept standing in front of the television yowling and then running to the stairs till my daughter got up to figure out why the cat was \"acting like Lassie\".",

                "review_text": "This recording of CATS features the original London cast, headed by Elaine Paige and Brian Blessed. Because it is the first official full-length recording of CATS, this does not always mean that the world-premiere rendition is always the best. The London cast gives a fairly adequate performance of the score, and perform it with a softer-grained approach as compared to their Broadway counterparts. And the lean-textured recording has sounded even better than before with this recent digital remastering. Elaine Paige may be acknowledged as a foremost interpreter of Grizabella, but here her performance shows that she neds some time to get into the spirit of the role. She does give a fine rentition of Memory that, despite competition from Betty Buckley, allows her to hold her own. Brian Blessed gives a firm, commanding and sonorous portrayal of Old Deuteronomy. He has a convicting voice that he demonstrates to great effect in his solos, even in his powerful Ad-Dressing of Cats. The lower-level principals don't seem to fare that well. Wayne Sleep as Mr. Mistoffelees and Paul Nicholas as Rum Tum Tugger cope adequately with the demands of the score, but they don't sing their parts with character and hence sound rather stilted. But nevertheless, most of the supporting cast members make up for these disappointments with crisp choral diction, even if their singing is a little laid back. The minor cats feature Myra Sands as a sprightly and no-nonsense Jennyanydots and Susan Jane Tanner as a soothing Jellylorum. Not to mention Bonnie Langford's lively portrayal of Rumpelteazer, and young Sarah Brightman's sweet, innocent and pure Jemima. Perhaps Jeff Shankley could be weak as Munkastrap here. And Stephen Tate makes a cameo appearance as a somewhat weak-voiced Gus: the Theatre Cat and Growltiger. The cast is ably supported by a firm hand in David Firman's direction of the orchestral accompaniments. It would be worth noting that this version of CATS is interesting in itself as a concept album. This is because the show underwent some extensive revisions for its Broadway premiere before the revisions were incorporated into all CATS productions worldwide. Almost the whole of the T.S. Eliot text is presented in this performance, with less verse cuts than the Broadway recording. In addition, you can also get to savour two draft versions of songs that were re-written. Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer is given a jazzy setting which, in context, sounds a little stilted as compared to the jaunty music-hall setting written for Broadway. But, it is still interesting in itself. And so is the Ballad of Billy M'Caw, included during Growltiger's Last Stand. It may be more restrained than the Italian aria, but it still shows the character that Growltiger could have adopted if this song was retained. Other than these two notable drawing-board versions, the early drafts are minor, but still interesting. On the whole, I find this performance of CATS lacking in some sort of joie de vivre and spirit. Yet, for its historical value, I still recommend it, and makes a good alternative listening experience as compared to the Broadway cast. The packaging in a slimline double-disc jewel case includes a booklet with some production photographs from the London production, a cast list and a poorly-produced libretto in small print. There is also an abridged version of this recording (like the Broadway cast version has) that makes an ideal introduction to this recording in general, and it features the same selections as its Broadway counterpart. As an aside, this recording of CATS is not wholly complete, because it lacks The Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles due to the need to accomodate space on record.",

                "review_text": "I do not mean to ruffle anybody's feathers in my comments of this particular CATS recording, However, of all the official English-language recordings this recording sounds a little stilted and wanting in that littbe bit of energy. Part of it could be due to some of the performances, and part of it because this album uses the first version of CATS. Yet despite the lack of oomph, it is quite good and redeems itself by the aura it projects for being the world-premiere recording of the score. This recording features the Grizabella of Elaine Paige, who can be considered a true Grizabella in her own right. It's true that this early recording doesn't allow her to nuance the role as she did in the video, but she conveys a strength and vulnerability in her portrayal. Paige's rendition of Memory is solid, but at this early stage she had yet to mature into the role. I guess that it's also because this recording used the single version of the song, and that's probably why it sounds stilted. Brian Blessed partners her with his sincere and benevolent portrayal of Old Deuteronomy, and the rest of the performers fare quite well. However, I found Paul Nicholas as The Rum Tum Tugger to be somewhat wanting in energy. He fares a little better in his rendition of Mr. Mistoffelees, but doesn't smoke it out in his standout number. I think this is pretty much the case for most of the performers here, as the performances of the cast as a whole sound solid yet stilted at the same time. The orchestrations are less flashy and somewhat weak but you can hear the sort of sound that Lloyd-Webber originally intended for the musical, and the variants. Yes, this West End cast recording is like a concept album of sorts, staying closer to the T.S. Eliot cat poems without cutting verses as in later productions. The redeeming feature of this West End cast recording are the variants of numbers that were changed in lature productions. One variant, the duet for Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer is set to an unvarying and jazzy melody that Lloyd-Webber replaced with the vaudeville-like version as heard on the Broadway video and in the video. The other variant is the duet for Growltiger and Griddlebone during Growltiger's Last Stand. Before this duet number was replaced with the better-fitting Puccini spoof, Growltiger and Griddlebone sang a rather unromantic drinking song about a musically talented parrot named Billy M'Caw. Even if Lloyd-Webber admits to preferring Billy M'Caw I tend to like the Puccini spoof a little better as it better integrates itself into the scene. For those who are used to the later versions of these numbers and to the beefed-up orchestration of the Broadway and video versions, this recording can offer a nice contrast.

The booklets are an improvement over those in the previous Polydor releases, as they have offered a better-print edition of the libretto and the production credits, including the musical numbers. However, I do admit that there isn't much of a difference in sound quality between this release and the original Polydor CD. The CDs appear to have been pressed from the original CD master rather than the better-sounding remastered version that was released in 1998.

This veterinarian recommended cat food promises to provide healthy weight loss for your 1-6 year old adult cat. It will, its manufacturers state, provide high quality protein, while still offering great taste. It has 10% less fat than Iams Original. L-carnitine helps burn fat and build lean muscle. In addition, the kibble is enhanced with vitamins, minerals, fish oil and energy-boosting amino acids that should help your cat reach/maintain a healthy weight, with a healthy shiny coat. A tailored fiber blend, including probiotics and beet pulp should support healthy digestion; seven ingredients are targeted to help support a healthy heart. More health benefits include: enrichment with antioxidants to help support a strong immune system; high quality protein to help your cat maintain strong muscles and taurine for healthy eyes. The product is manufactured by a subsidiary of Proctor and Gamble that boasts 60 years\u2019 experience, offers a rewards program, and is backed by a 100% guarantee. Well, the cats in this house, like the people, struggle with those few extra pounds, though, of course, they don\u2019t know it. Except insofar as their diets are restricted. And poor DIvo, who at one time weighed a distinctly chubby 22 pounds; had to be kept on a tightly-restricted diet, three small meals a day of vet\u2019s prescription food for many months to get him down to 16 pounds, moaned and groaned about it, too. Peachy, of a much quieter disposition, had doubled his weight in the year since I took him home from the pound. So: weight control for both of them; at any rate, it\u2019s really very difficult to attempt to feed cats separately. They seem to like this kibble well-enough, however, gobble it down when presented for breakfast, lunch or dinner. They don\u2019t seem to mind getting it for every meal. It\u2019s really unfair, of course: I can enforce a strict diet on the cats, but not on my husband or, heaven forbid, me. Nevertheless, recommended.",

                "review_text": "This recording of CATS features the original London cast, headed by Elaine Paige and Brian Blessed. Because it is the first official full-length recording of CATS, this does not always mean that the world-premiere rendition is always the best. The London cast gives a fairly adequate performance of the score, and perform it with a softer-grained approach as compared to their Broadway counterparts. And the lean-textured recording has sounded even better than before with this recent digital remastering. Elaine Paige may be acknowledged as a foremost interpreter of Grizabella, but here her performance shows that she neds some time to get into the spirit of the role. She does give a fine rentition of Memory that, despite competition from Betty Buckley, allows her to hold her own. Brian Blessed gives a firm, commanding and sonorous portrayal of Old Deuteronomy. He has a convicting voice that he demonstrates to great effect in his solos, even in his powerful Ad-Dressing of Cats. The lower-level principals don't seem to fare that well. Wayne Sleep as Mr. Mistoffelees and Paul Nicholas as Rum Tum Tugger cope adequately with the demands of the score, but they don't sing their parts with character and hence sound rather stilted. But nevertheless, most of the supporting cast members make up for these disappointments with crisp choral diction, even if their singing is a little laid back. The minor cats feature Myra Sands as a sprightly and no-nonsense Jennyanydots and Susan Jane Tanner as a soothing Jellylorum. Not to mention Bonnie Langford's lively portrayal of Rumpelteazer, and young Sarah Brightman's sweet, innocent and pure Jemima. Perhaps Jeff Shankley could be weak as Munkastrap here. And Stephen Tate makes a cameo appearance as a somewhat weak-voiced Gus: the Theatre Cat and Growltiger. The cast is ably supported by a firm hand in David Firman's direction of the orchestral accompaniments. It would be worth noting that this version of CATS is interesting in itself as a concept album. This is because the show underwent some extensive revisions for its Broadway premiere before the revisions were incorporated into all CATS productions worldwide. Almost the whole of the T.S. Eliot text is presented in this performance, with less verse cuts than the Broadway recording. In addition, you can also get to savour two draft versions of songs that were re-written. Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer is given a jazzy setting which, in context, sounds a little stilted as compared to the jaunty music-hall setting written for Broadway. But, it is still interesting in itself. And so is the Ballad of Billy M'Caw, included during Growltiger's Last Stand. It may be more restrained than the Italian aria, but it still shows the character that Growltiger could have adopted if this song was retained. Other than these two notable drawing-board versions, the early drafts are minor, but still interesting. On the whole, I find this performance of CATS lacking in some sort of joie de vivre and spirit. Yet, for its historical value, I still recommend it, and makes a good alternative listening experience as compared to the Broadway cast. The packaging in a slimline double-disc jewel case includes a booklet with some production photographs from the London production, a cast list and a poorly-produced libretto in small print. There is also an abridged version of this recording (like the Broadway cast version has) that makes an ideal introduction to this recording in general, and it features the same selections as its Broadway counterpart. As an aside, this recording of CATS is not wholly complete, because it lacks The Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles due to the need to accomodate space on record.",

                "review_text": "I do not mean to ruffle anybody's feathers in my comments of this particular CATS recording, However, of all the official English-language recordings this recording sounds a little stilted and wanting in that littbe bit of energy. Part of it could be due to some of the performances, and part of it because this album uses the first version of CATS. Yet despite the lack of oomph, it is quite good and redeems itself by the aura it projects for being the world-premiere recording of the score. This recording features the Grizabella of Elaine Paige, who can be considered a true Grizabella in her own right. It's true that this early recording doesn't allow her to nuance the role as she did in the video, but she conveys a strength and vulnerability in her portrayal. Paige's rendition of Memory is solid, but at this early stage she had yet to mature into the role. I guess that it's also because this recording used the single version of the song, and that's probably why it sounds stilted. Brian Blessed partners her with his sincere and benevolent portrayal of Old Deuteronomy, and the rest of the performers fare quite well. However, I found Paul Nicholas as The Rum Tum Tugger to be somewhat wanting in energy. He fares a little better in his rendition of Mr. Mistoffelees, but doesn't smoke it out in his standout number. I think this is pretty much the case for most of the performers here, as the performances of the cast as a whole sound solid yet stilted at the same time. The orchestrations are less flashy and somewhat weak but you can hear the sort of sound that Lloyd-Webber originally intended for the musical, and the variants. Yes, this West End cast recording is like a concept album of sorts, staying closer to the T.S. Eliot cat poems without cutting verses as in later productions. The redeeming feature of this West End cast recording are the variants of numbers that were changed in lature productions. One variant, the duet for Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer is set to an unvarying and jazzy melody that Lloyd-Webber replaced with the vaudeville-like version as heard on the Broadway video and in the video. The other variant is the duet for Growltiger and Griddlebone during Growltiger's Last Stand. Before this duet number was replaced with the better-fitting Puccini spoof, Growltiger and Griddlebone sang a rather unromantic drinking song about a musically talented parrot named Billy M'Caw. Even if Lloyd-Webber admits to preferring Billy M'Caw I tend to like the Puccini spoof a little better as it better integrates itself into the scene. For those who are used to the later versions of these numbers and to the beefed-up orchestration of the Broadway and video versions, this recording can offer a nice contrast. Yet in my view they have only made the rewrites and revisions that Lloyd-Webber added to the score for the rest of the productions much better. Despite my feelings, at least the aura of this recording is enough to save it from being stilted, despite the solid performances from everyone concerned. And besides, it includes extra verses that were cut for the Broadway and subsequent productions of the show, so it makes this album feel closer to the T.S. Eliot poems. It's good to see this recording in a reissue that treats it with respect. The 2 CDs come in a slimline double-disc case, packaged in a neat slipcase. The booklets are an improvement over those in the previous Polydor releases, as they have offered a better-print edition of the libretto and the production credits, including the musical numbers. However, I do admit that there isn't much of a difference in sound quality between this release and the original Polydor CD. The CDs appear to have been pressed from the original CD master rather than the better-sounding remastered version that was released in 1998. I know that if I were to recommend this West End cast recording I would recommend the 1998 remastered version, as it sounds less muffled compared to the sound on this release. Yet it would not be practical because that 1998 CD costs a whopping 65 dollars. In short, even if CATS fans covet this recording I'm sorry to say I don't covet it as much as they do. I acknowledge its strengths, but yet I know it sounds a little stilted on the whole. Even so, this recording redeems itself with its solid performance and the aura of it representing the first thoughts of Andrew Lloyd-Webber and staying close to T.S. Eliot's source material before the show was tweaked and altered for Broadway. But my first choice for a CATS recording still lies with the Broadway cast Cats: Complete Original Broadway Cast Recording (1982 Original Broadway Cast) as it's got this energy that makes the show work, without destroying its spirit and nature.",

The item itself came in a flimsy plastic box. The box lid didn't have any kind of a seal on it and it popped open during shipping. The phone stand was rolling around in the package when I picked it up. Having looked it over, the phone stand is simple which I like, but mine had a minor paint defect where the whisker was painted outside the grove. The feet are un-padded. Don't place it on easily scratch-able surfaces unless you add felt feet. And as I said, the product has a scratch on the butt. I would have priced the stand at $10. It's not completely worth the $16, but I couldn't find any other cat stands I liked sooooo- >_>; The item itself is super cute. The simple design looks good. It's decently weighted, but don't get crazy. The cradle part seems thin, but this isn't a problem because it is lined with a small piece of felt/ faux-velvet to add a little more grip.

Reading some other reviews, I was worried that they were too big (and would ultimately not use it). One of my cats spends a lot of time in the basket. It is a little snug but she seems to enjoy being cradled. The hammock and hide-out space on the second level are not useful as they fit small kittens best. However, my cats really enjoy the other spaces and hanging out here. I set this up alone and it took about 30 minutes. I have been using this for over 1 year without any problems. *UPDATE* I will have had this for 3 years this coming December. The bottom tiers are still going strong, but as some other reviewers have mentioned the top perch is now broken and the stairs have detached. I'm leaving this as 5 stars still, though, because for $70 it lasted quite a while for my cats. Please rate this review as \"helpful\" if it helped you! Thanks",

We left the cylinder tunnel off and to the side because the baby of the 4 loves to roll around in it. It's very durable. We have adult 3 cats ranging from 12-14 lbs and 1 young adult cat that's 8 lbs. All 4 of them are on it at the same time frequently and it hasn't broken or tipped over. The heaviest fell off while rolling in catnip and it withheld him freaking out and hanging on for his life, so I don't think it'll fall anytime soon. The little bowl that hangs out on the side holds the heaviest cat with ease as well. My only complaint is that the hammock falls off easily, but it's to be expected with the hooks it comes with. If I remember, I will follow up in 3 months to add how it's handled my crazy fur babies. *UPDATE* So, I remembered! About 1.5 months into excessive use, the top tier became too lose and no amount of screwing it in would make it stay. We even tried some glue, but it was too wobbly. I ended up using the wood Gorilla Glue to keep it together and it holds up well without a screw. My littlest cat loves the bowl and has torn up the rope. He managed to unbraid it. My eldest cat would only scratch the front post and he scratched it into oblivion, so I turned over the tower and switched it with another poll to let him keep scratching. Last, we ended up switching the hammock because they love to play through the hole in the middle tier. Overall, I still say I definitely got my money's worth. It's used daily by 4 cats and to be completely honest, I didn't expect to last this long. **December 2016 Update** Besides everything I've mentioned, I wanted to share how I revamped the tower. I'm in the process of replacing all the rope posts with some rope I bought off here. Despite being in the middle of a DIY project, I wanted to share how it looks and my cats are in love with it. The only reason why I'm putting so much effort into keeping this tower is that my husband's baby is in love with the bowl, so I can't take it away from him. Lol Oh yeah. I bought a bed to go on the top since the perch was long gone. Turns out that it was a good idea. :) I hope my extensive review helped and gave ideas to all those who've read! Here's the rope that I bought to redo the scratching posts: T.W . Evans Cordage 23-410 3/8-Inch by 100-Feet Twisted Sisal Rope https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00DKA3OGO/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_BTdvyb4Z4Y984 I just used a hot glue gun and did 2 rows glue, 2 rows wrapped tight without glue, then just kept alternating. You'll need to buy 2 if you're wanting to completely redo the bottom.",

The little hanging basket thing is probably only big enough for a kitten, but everyone knows the \"if i [barely] fits, I sits\" rule. There is a screw that may be compromising some reviewers' trees, making them unsteady or loose after some wear and tear. It's a double ended screw and some people may not be distributing its threads equally between posts (because it is possible to keep screwing it past it's designated point). If you screw the post in without holding the screw in place, it will keep screwing further into the initial (wrong) post leaving very little support for the post you are trying to attach. Overall this cat tree is very sturdy if built correctly and my cat loves it. Would highly recommend. If you found this review helpful, rate it helpful. It would be much appreciated!",

This product definitely has some design flaws that can bring terrible potential danger to your cat. The hammock part at the bottom is held by only four little hooks that have no protection units for hiding the protruding part, and the hammock can fall off so easily. Today, the hammock fell off easily again while my cat was playing on the tree, and all of the sudden, I found her struggling there because her eyelid got hooked by the hook!!! I rescued her off hook and she was literally bleeding!! It was so lucky that I happen to be at home, or else I can't image what would happen if she was home alone and tried to get out of hook by herself. IT WOULD MADE HER BLIND!!

This product had a myriad of great reviews so I decided to try it out. Upon opening the box the first thing I noticed was that the fabric used to cover the tree is very low quality - It reminds me of the material used to make stuffed animals. It's very soft and feels very thin. The second thing I noticed is that the the little \"cubby\" on the 2nd platform is VERY small. I truly believe that only a kitten or very very small car would be able to use this. During assembly, I noticed that the screws/bolts were never able to get actually tight - they seemed to just keep spinning, and never get snug. Due to this, when my cat is on one top platforms it is. Very wobbly and unstable. Despite my initial thoughts, we decided to keep it for a week or two since it was already put together. We quickly found that the material used to cover it began to shed and leave little brown fuzzies everywhere! I was a little disappointed with this item, and will continue my search for a cat tree.",

He wants to talk to you about your poem, \"One Day.\" He says, \"you may be funny, and you may know a few things about cats, but let me tell you. You are right that we are not equal, but every feline knows who's really in command, and we don't need to wear the pair of your slacks we just peed on to prove it. And seeing as we can reduce you silly humans to a pile of gibberish with a nonstop flood of puddles or aromatic piles, the people who feed us will *never* be our equals, and we cats know who's really in command here.\" So, Catzilla's comments aside, because yah, he totally wears the Emperor's hat in this house, and should we ever doubt it, he sends his sidekick, Sith Whispicus out to reinforce his demands...this is a funny book, if you've ever had a cat with a touch of the spiteful in him. Cough *Catzilla*. And mostly, I think the author gets it right. I bought this book for my daughter, but I did some reading myself when it came in today because when I had looked at the on-line preview, it made me laugh. And I always like a good laugh. I do have to say though, my favorite cat humor book remains \"A Cat's Night Before Christmas,\" by Beard/Jones/Boswell. It used to leave me gasping for air every time I read it, until it became my daughter's favorite book as a toddler. And we read it over, and over, and over because that's what toddler's do. And being able to quote it from memory allows me to breath when it's read, but I can still smile when thinking about it. So that's a good one to try too, and very on point if you're a cat owner. But otherwise, I thought this one was funny in a more artsy kind of way, and I know my daughter is going to love reading it as well.",

The author of \"I Could Pee on This\" is breaking the news to those who have been ignorant in their bliss. The cats have won. They are in charge. You don't believe it? Well, who's the one cleaning the litter box? Francesco Marciuliano knows cats. From feline typewriter fixation to toilet paper destruction to shattered wineglasses, the man has suffered\u2013\u2013as have we all\u2013\u2013at the paws of cats. And for the love of the diabolical little suckers, he\u2013\u2013as do all we cat captives\u2013\u2013keeps coming back for more. See \"This Is My Chair\" for your Cat's attitude towards property rights, \"Busy, Busy\" for cat sleeping habits. \"I Run\" reveals a cat's intense desire to appear to know what he's doing. \"Tripped\" and \"Talk to Me\" reveal your cat's devious nature and possible criminal intent. In \"Kneal (sic) before Me\" the true nature of Cat/human relations is revealed. \"Nudge\" has been my own personal experience with five cats over 60 years, so that one is absolutely dead-on right. Blush at \"Man's Best Friend\" because it's probably true. \"Family\" is very likely true\u2013\u2013you aren't that important. Every cat is the center of his own universe. You are just a satellite. \"I Lick Your Nose\" is so true that I've bought thicker makeup to cover scratch scars from the cat who repositions me to suit his favored sleeping spots during the night. This is done by digging into my cheek or eye socket and pulling. When accomplished during REM sleep, I don't discover Rowdy's act of violence until I wash my face in the morning. And, of course, the title piece says it all: Your cat will dominate you at every turn. I laughed all the way through \"I Could Pee on This,\" often reading pertinent verses to my husband as we lay in the dark, me reading my Kindle, he drifting off to sleep. He didn't always react as I would have hoped. I'm hoping it was because he was half-asleep. I've converted him to being a cat person. But does the dog person in him still prevail? Rowdy, Jeep, Liam, Smokey and I must get together and work on him. If forty-two years of cat domination haven't quite converted him yet, we'll have to take more drastic action.... KL",

She has dementia and my 88 year old father could no longer care for her. We worried about the time she would spend there when no one was visiting or during the periods of time with no activities. Because of his, I got her a joy for all cat. She has always been a nurturer, as a mother and grandmother, and has also loved animals. I am happy to say that this was one of the best purchases I have ever made. She enjoys petting the cat and the reactions she gets from her touch. It is truly remarkable what this cat can do. It is very lifelike and although my mother knows it isn't real she enjoys it nonetheless. The nurses and CNAs are all enamoured with her cat as well! She is the most popular resident on the floor! The 'toy' appeals to all ages. My 10 year old niece spent time visiting with my mom and her cat. The interaction they shared was very special and allowed my niece an opportunity to connect with my mom. After taking my mother back to the nursing home after Thanksgiving dinner, she was reluctant to be there as we entered her room. Thank goodness for the cat, which redirected her thoughts and allowed her to settle in calmly. I am so thankful for this companion for my mom!",

                "review_text": "I bought my first orange tabby cat on November 18. It was a huge hit with my 89 year old father-in-law \u2014 he has dementia, and in recent months has been pulling further into his figurative shell. He LOVES the cat. He believes it is real, talks to it, laughs with it, pets it, interacts with it. His mood has improved dramatically, and he is more alert. This cat is a FIVE STAR concept and a FIVE STAR addition to the lives of older people (& their caregivers). However, the product is ONE STAR in terms of reliability. My FIL loved it so much he broke it. We think he held the head too tightly, and ultimately the servos broke. The cat still meows and purrs, but it no longer rolls onto its back and the eyes no longer open. The heartbreaking thing is now my FIL asks the kitty why she isn't opening her eyes. Dear Hasbro Product Managers: keep it simpler. The cat doesn't need to roll onto its back for a tummy rub. The meowing, purring, and eyes/mouth movements probably solve 90% of the \"real\" factor, and are less prone to breaking. As a side comment, I now face a very real problem: my FIL loves this cat. There is no vet I can take it to. Instead, I've bought a replacement cat. Yes, you read that right, I've bought 2 $100 robo-cats in less than one month because this kitty is bringing very real joy to my FIL, and some much needed relief to his round-the-clock caregivers. The value per hour is astronomical, and this cat pays for itself many times over. That said, Hasbro would be wise to figure out how they're going to handle replacements/repairs/breakage. At any rate, I look forward to further improvements in this product line. And hopefully I won't have to buy a baker's dozen before we get there...",

                "review_text": "I bought this for my 94 year old grandmother to keep her company after remembering that she grew up with cats. I was a bit skeptical, having two (real) cats of my own, but decided to give it a shot. FAMILY RATINGS: - Grandma (4 stars): It took her a couple of hours to get used to it (she's not at all tech savvy and a moving toy freaked her out), but it's been a couple of weeks and \"Kitty\" (creative, I know) is still hanging out with her. Like one of the previous reviews also mentioned, she is well aware that it's not a real cat, but she plays and talks with it almost as if it were real. - Mom (4 stars): She thinks it's cute and enjoys playing with it... possibly a little more than my grandma since she better understands the logic behind its movements. - Me (2.5 stars): If I had purchased this for myself, I would have returned it (Reminder: I have 2 real, live cats to cuddle with at my leisure so this machine just doesn't compare). But, as a gift for my grandmother, it's really comforting to know that she has something nice to interact with when no one else is home. - My cats (see video - haha) PROS: - Fur is soft, almost life-like - Meowing sounds are cute, though slightly comical - Purring sound and vibrations are surprisingly nice - No need for food, water, poop scooping... or band aids :) CONS: - Whirring sounds during movements are really audible (you'll never forget it's a machine) - Occasional spastic movements with annoyingly loud clicking - As mentioned in one of the first comments, there is a bit of Satan in this cat. Just don't let its \"sigh\" catch you off guard in a dimly lit room while you're alone. It still creeps me out. OTHER COMMENTS: - I wish there was a better range of movement (i.e. when it \"rolls back\") and had more padding to make the toy feel more realistic - The toy's sensors are light activated. If there isn't a source of light coming from your direction, the cat won't notice your movement and react accordingly.",

The only time the pens will skip is if I've left the cap off for awhile without using the pen and try to immediately use it again. So make sure you keep the caps on!

The glasses are very clear, not cheap greenish glass, thicker than a typical high-end wine glass, but the added thickness should make them less likely to chip or break if knocked against some other object. The laser etching is a bit faint, and it doesn't compare to old-school mechanical engraving, but it's flawless and attractively designed. Of course, it won't wear off in the dishwasher, like glasses with enameled artwork. These are huge glasses, which might be too big for small hands. They hold about 14 ounces, which is nearly three standard 5-ounce servings of wine! So, beware when filling, unless your objective is to get blotto in a hurry. They are approximately the same size and shape as the \"NOTMOG\" (not made of glass) plastic wine glasses I bought a couple of years ago, but the real glass feels better in the hand. See: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01A7UB3RQ for details. I think it would be great if this seller offered the same laser-etched designs on the NOTMOG plastic, for safe outdoor / patio use.

If some of the other ones being sold offered that feature I would have chosen one of the others, but I suspect they all come from the same manufacturer, so I think this is just what you get regardless. The soft white nightlight function is perfectly fine and it is a good amount of soothing light - not too much, not too dim. The silicone is quite soft; it doesn't hold up against touch easily. This shouldn't be a problem if it's a stationary nightlight, of course, but a consideration if this might be something you'd be using for a child who wants something to carry along to the bathroom. It should be sturdy enough, but I'm not sure how well it would survive being dropped, etc. What's nice about this is that, obviously, it's seriously adorable. It's also bigger than I expected; I didn't read the product description regarding height because I didn't really care one way or another; just wanted a nightlight like this. It's actually about six inches tall and pretty wide, so it puts off plenty of nice, soft light.",

I do not care for the look of extended chains nor spring clasp, so I would like to put it on my chain that has a lobster clasp and no extension on it. This is my only mild issue with the necklace, not big enough to change my star rating. I got it in matte versus the polished look and it looks like white gold instead of the .925 silver that it is. I get comments and compliments every time I wear it. It is worth every penny I spent on it. If you love cats, this is a perfect way to say so. I recommend this highly.

I wouldn't really try to read anything more into it than that. I had earlier gotten the 2 video version and was somewhat disappointed by the sound; you can barely hear the cast during 'The Naming of Cats' and in several spots the music overpowers the voices. Turning up the volume on your TV gives you quite a bit of static and popping instead of clarity. This seems to be from either a bad master VHS or simply how they did this version; they recorded a 90 piece orchestra (as Webber mentions most theatres use about 16 pieces), then the singers, then shot the choreography but didn't use that vocal recording. So really you're hearing 2 recordings dubbed onto the dancing and in spots it really shows. On the DVD however the sound is much better. Most of the songs are very clear ('Naming of Cats' is still very low)and only in a few spots do you notice sound effects that got forgotten from video to DVD. The picture is slightly better as well but the improved sound is the real reason to get DVD over VHS. The major addition to the bonus features is about 7 ten minute or so interveiws with the original production staff; it makes a nice contrast to how the show is now and what it went through to even be shown as a musical. My only major complaint about the DVD is the very flimsy case; basically it is a tri-folded plastic sheet with 2 thin DVD/CD rounds and a small booklet. As a final thought all you married men out there probably shouldn't pay too close attention to the dancing during the 'Macavity' number.",

Having seen the play twice more I was excited to learn it was now available on video. Bottom line is it's a great addition to any collection. Partridge is delightful as he chews up the scenery as Rum Tug Tugger in a much more narcisistic, and to my mind appropriate portrayal of the character than I had seen before. Sir John Mills was a treat as Old Gus, and frankly I think the elimination of the Growltigger sequence did nothing but improve the play. I would have paid the price of a play ticket for the video just to have the opportunity to watch it whenever I needed my Cats 'fix'. Although it doesn't give you the opportunity to take your eyes away from the action and look at the subtext on other parts of the stage, it does show the interaction of the cats on screen in a much more intimate context. I think the trade off is worth it to see the performance in this new way.",

Lastly, for our account purposes we need the itemized invoice for what is being paid for in the current invoice. Currently I have to find the previous months invoice to get the itemized list so I can pay the current month's invoice. So in other words, the amount that is due should also have the itemized invoice in the following pages in addition to the other active charges. I can't pay for an item if I can't code it in our budget and I shouldn't have to flip between different invoices from different months to figure it out. Keep it simple.
